## Observed Rates (Among 99 Filers)

| Metric | Rate |
|---|---|
| Waive rate among people who filed | **44.4%** |
| Completed refund rate among filers | **33.3%** |
| Still active / in-process rate | **22.2%** |
| Avg ticket value waived per person | $115.18 |
| Avg refund paid out per person | $184.22 |
| Avg ticket value in no-filer pool | $174.31 |

> **Critical context**: The site launched February 14, 2026. All 99 filers submitted within the first 5 days. These are the most engaged, most community-connected members of the NeoKizFest audience — the early adopters who were watching closely and moved immediately. The 44.4% waive rate reflects this self-selected group. As the broader audience discovers the site over the coming weeks, the waive rate will likely come down and the refund rate will rise. The 106 no-filers are not gone dark — they simply haven't heard yet or are still deciding.

---

## Donations (Standalone)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total donors | 35 |
| Total donated | $2,815.00 |
| Waived *and* donated (overlap) | 9 people / $905.00 |
| Pure donors (no pass held) | 26 people |
| Avg donation per donor | $80.43 |

> Donations are treated as a community offset — not revenue expected to cover refund liability, but a meaningful signal of support that reduces net burden.

## Forecast: The 106 No-Filers

106 ticket holders (52% of all) have not yet submitted a request.
Their collective ticket value is **$18,476.95**.

**Important framing**: The site launched February 14th. The 106 no-filers are not disengaged — they're the second and third wave. As awareness spreads, filing rates will climb significantly. The early-filer waive rate of 44.4% is almost certainly a ceiling, not a baseline — later filers tend to be less community-connected and more focused on getting their money back. Scenarios reflect this expected shift.

### Conservative — 40% of no-filers file, 20% of those waive
*Most of the remaining audience wants refunds; limited awareness of waive option.*
| | Value |
|---|---|
| New filers from no-filer pool | 42 |
| New waivers | 8 (+$921.45) |
| New refunds to pay | 34 (~$5,926.56) |
| **Total waived all time** | **52 — $5,989.41** |
| **Total liability remaining** | **$10,343.84** |
| Pool never files | 64 holders / $11,154.84 |

### Moderate — 55% of no-filers file, 25% of those waive
*Solid reach via word of mouth; a quarter still choose to give it back.*
| | Value |
|---|---|
| New filers from no-filer pool | 58 |
| New waivers | 15 (+$1,727.73) |
| New refunds to pay | 43 (~$7,495.56) |
| **Total waived all time** | **59 — $6,795.69** |
| **Total liability remaining** | **$11,912.84** |
| Pool never files | 48 holders / $8,367.29 |

### Optimistic — 70% of no-filers file, 30% of those waive
*High awareness, strong community response — waive rate holds closer to early pattern.*
| | Value |
|---|---|
| New filers from no-filer pool | 74 |
| New waivers | 22 (+$2,533.96) |
| New refunds to pay | 52 (~$9,064.12) |
| **Total waived all time** | **66 — $7,601.92** |
| **Total liability remaining** | **$13,481.40** |
| Pool never files | 32 holders / $5,574.72 |

## Scenario B — Trend Continuation (Social Proof Effect)

**Assumption: the 44.4% waive rate holds** — sustained by the public badge wall, community messages, artist testimonials, and the emotional weight of the farewell story. Seeing 44 people's initials displayed and reading *"I believed in you then, and I still do"* creates real pull to join that group. The site was designed, intentionally, to make that choice visible and honored.

This is not wishful thinking — it's how social proof works. The waive option isn't buried. It's celebrated.

| Filing rate among 106 no-filers | New filers | New waivers | New refunds | Total waivers (all time) | % of all 205 holders | Remaining liability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 40% (42 people) | 42 | 19 | 23 | **63** | 30.7% | $8,426.41 |
| 55% (58 people) | 58 | 26 | 32 | **70** | 34.1% | $9,995.20 |
| 70% (74 people) | 74 | 33 | 41 | **77** | 37.6% | $11,564.00 |
| 85% (90 people) | 90 | 40 | 50 | **84** | 41.0% | $13,132.78 |
| 100% (all 106) | 106 | 47 | 59 | **91** | **44.4%** | $14,700.00 |

**The headline number**: if the 44.4% waive rate holds across all 205 ticket holders, **91 people** will have waived their refunds — nearly half the entire festival — forgiving a collective **$10,481.38**.

That would mean almost 1 in 2 NeoKizFest ticket holders looked at this situation and said *keep it* — not because they were asked to, but because 90 other people did, because the site told the story honestly, and because what Charles built meant something to them.

## Worst-Case Total Liability
If every single one of the 106 no-filers filed a full refund (zero additional waivers):
- Additional exposure: $18,476.95
- Combined with active: **$22,894.23**

Realistic range given site is only 5 days old: **$10,300–$13,500**
*(This will sharpen significantly within 2–3 weeks as filing velocity becomes clear.)*

## The Full Community Picture
| What the community did | # of people | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Waived their refund | 44 | $5,067.96 |
| Donated (all donors) | 35 | $2,815.00 |
| Waived + donated | 9 | $905.00 (subset of above two) |
| **Unique people who gave something back** | **70** | **$7,882.96** |

**34% of all 205 ticket holders** — in the first 5 days alone — did something to actively support Charles and the festival rather than simply request their money back. This number will shift as the broader audience catches up, but the early signal is extraordinary.

## Velocity Check-ins (Recommended)
- [ ] **Day 14 (Feb 28)** — Check filing rate, see if pace is slowing or accelerating
- [ ] **Day 30 (Mar 15)** — Refresh all numbers; waive rate should be stabilizing
- [ ] **Day 60 (Apr 14)** — Near-final snapshot; most who will file have filed
- [ ] **Final** — Refresh when process reaches ~85–90% completion
- [ ] Update `refund-system-recap.md` with final numbers for the community post
