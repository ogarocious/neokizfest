## ⚠️ Payment Status Note
**Zelle payments paused as of Feb 22, 2026** — monthly transfer limit reached.
Payments resume ~March 1, 2026 when the limit resets.
The 44 "Completed" refunds reflect all Zelle transfers that went out before the pause.
The 6 active requests are approved/in-queue and will be paid first when payments resume.
Wise (international) is unaffected.

## Observed Rates (Among 109 Filers)

| Metric | Day 5 (99 filers) | Day 9 (109 filers) |
|---|---|---|
| Waive rate among people who filed | 44.4% | **46.8%** |
| Completed refund rate among filers | 33.3% | **40.4%** |
| Still active / in-process rate | 22.2% | **5.5%** |
| Avg ticket value waived per person | $115.18 | **$113.70** |
| Avg refund paid out per person | $184.22 | **$165.02** |
| Avg ticket value in no-filer pool | $174.31 | **$166.78** |

> The waive rate has ticked up slightly (44.4% → 46.8%) as more people file. The active backlog has collapsed from 22 requests to 6 — the bulk of the queue has been processed. The remaining 6 are held only by the Zelle pause, not by any review delay.

> **Critical context**: These 109 filers are still largely the early-mover, community-connected segment. The waive rate will likely come down as awareness reaches the broader audience. The ~96 no-filers are not disengaged — they're the second and third wave.

---

## Donations (Standalone)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Total donors | 34 |
| Total donated | $2,815.00 |
| Waived *and* donated (overlap) | 9 people |
| Avg donation per donor | $82.79 |

> Unchanged from Day 5. Donations continue to serve as a community offset — not expected revenue, but a meaningful signal that reduces net burden.

---

## Forecast: The ~96 No-Filers

~96 ticket holders (~47% of all) have not yet submitted a request.
Their collective ticket value is approximately **$16,010.60**.
Average ticket value in this pool: **~$166.78**.

**Important framing**: Day 9 of a process most people don't check daily. This pool is not gone — they're the second and third wave. Waive rate among later filers will likely come in lower than 46.8% as the community-connected early movers are already counted. Scenarios reflect this.

### Conservative — 40% of no-filers file, 20% of those waive
*Most of the remaining audience wants refunds; limited awareness of waive option.*
| | Value |
|---|---|
| New filers from no-filer pool | 38 |
| New waivers | 8 (+$1,334) |
| New refunds to pay | 30 (~$5,003) |
| **Total waived all time** | **59 — $7,133** |
| **Active liability remaining** | ~$7,355 (current + new refunds) |
| Pool never files | ~58 holders / ~$9,673 |

### Moderate — 55% of no-filers file, 25% of those waive
*Solid reach via outreach; a quarter still choose to give it back.*
| | Value |
|---|---|
| New filers from no-filer pool | 53 |
| New waivers | 13 (+$2,168) |
| New refunds to pay | 40 (~$6,671) |
| **Total waived all time** | **64 — $7,967** |
| **Active liability remaining** | ~$9,023 |
| Pool never files | ~43 holders / ~$7,172 |

### Optimistic — 70% of no-filers file, 30% of those waive
*High awareness, strong community response.*
| | Value |
|---|---|
| New filers from no-filer pool | 67 |
| New waivers | 20 (+$3,336) |
| New refunds to pay | 47 (~$7,839) |
| **Total waived all time** | **71 — $9,135** |
| **Active liability remaining** | ~$10,191 |
| Pool never files | ~29 holders / ~$4,837 |

## Scenario B — Trend Continuation (46.8% Waive Rate Holds)

If the current 46.8% waive rate holds across all future filers — sustained by the public badge wall, community messages, and the farewell story:

| Filing rate among ~96 no-filers | New filers | New waivers | New refunds | Total waivers (all time) | % of all 205 | Remaining liability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 40% (~38 people) | 38 | 18 | 20 | **69** | 33.7% | ~$5,687 |
| 55% (~53 people) | 53 | 25 | 28 | **76** | 37.1% | ~$7,019 |
| 70% (~67 people) | 67 | 31 | 36 | **82** | 40.0% | ~$8,352 |
| 85% (~82 people) | 82 | 38 | 44 | **89** | 43.4% | ~$9,685 |
| 100% (all 96) | 96 | 45 | 51 | **96** | **46.8%** | ~$10,851 |

**Headline**: if 46.8% holds all the way, **96 people** (nearly half the festival) will have waived — forgiving a collective **~$13,335** in ticket value. Almost 1 in 2 NeoKizFest pass holders looked at this and said *keep it*.

---

## Worst-Case Total Liability
If every single one of the ~96 no-filers filed a full refund (zero additional waivers):
- Additional exposure: ~$16,010.60
- Combined with active: **~$18,362.28**

Realistic range given current trajectory: **$7,000–$11,000**
*(Significantly tighter than Day 5 estimate of $10,300–$13,500 — the active backlog collapsed from 22 to 6.)*

---

## The Full Community Picture
| What the community did | # of people | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Waived their refund | 51 | $5,798.90 |
| Donated (all donors) | 34 | $2,815.00 |
| Waived + donated | 9 | (subset of above two) |
| **Unique people who gave something back** | **76** | **$8,613.90** |

**37.1% of all 205 ticket holders** — by Day 9 — did something to actively support Charles and the festival rather than simply request their money back. Up from 34% on Day 5.

## Velocity Check-ins (Recommended)
- [ ] **Day 14 (Feb 28)** — Check filing rate, see if pace is slowing or accelerating. Zelle should be back online.
- [ ] **Day 30 (Mar 15)** — Refresh all numbers; waive rate should be stabilizing
- [ ] **Day 60 (Apr 14)** — Near-final snapshot; most who will file have filed
- [ ] **Final** — Refresh when process reaches ~85–90% completion
- [ ] Update `refund-system-recap.md` with final numbers for the community post
