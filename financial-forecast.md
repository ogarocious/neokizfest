## Observed Rates (Among 140 Filers)

| Metric | Day 9 (109 filers) | Day 14 (140 filers) |
|---|---|---|
| Waive rate among people who filed | 46.8% | **47.1%** |
| Completed refund rate among filers | 40.4% | **33.6%** |

| Avg refund paid out per person | $165.02 | **$156.71** |
| Avg ticket value in no-filer pool | $166.78 | **~$135.66 (est.)** |

> The waive rate has held remarkably steady (46.8% → 47.1%) as 31 more people filed. The active backlog grew from 6 to 27 — all held by the Zelle pause, not by any review delay. The non-filer pool has shrunk from ~96 to 53 as filing pace continues.

> **Chargeback note**: 11 chargebacks ($5,310.94) confirmed in Notion. Stripe dispute fees (~$15 each ≈ $165 total) are an additional cost not tracked here.

## Forecast: The 53 Remaining Non-Filers

53 ticket holders (~26% of all) have not yet submitted a request.
Their collective ticket value: **~$7,190 (est.)** · Average: **~$135.66/holder**.

*(The no-filer pool has shrunk from ~96 on Day 9 to 53 on Day 14. 43+ people filed over 5 days.)*

### Conservative — 40% of no-filers file, 20% of those waive
*Most want refunds; limited continued awareness.*
| | Value |
|---|---|
| New filers from pool | 21 |
| New waivers | 4 (+~$543) |
| New refunds to pay | 17 (~$2,306) |
| **Total waived all time** | **~70** |
| **Additional liability** | ~$2,306 |

### Moderate — 55% of no-filers file, 25% of those waive
*Solid continued reach; a quarter give it back.*
| | Value |
|---|---|
| New filers from pool | 29 |
| New waivers | 7 (+~$950) |
| New refunds to pay | 22 (~$2,985) |
| **Total waived all time** | **~73** |
| **Additional liability** | ~$2,985 |

### Optimistic — 70% of no-filers file, 30% of those waive
*High awareness, strong community response.*
| | Value |
|---|---|
| New filers from pool | 37 |
| New waivers | 11 (+~$1,493) |
| New refunds to pay | 26 (~$3,527) |
| **Total waived all time** | **~77** |
| **Additional liability** | ~$3,527 |

---

## Scenario B — Trend Continuation (47.1% Waive Rate Holds)

If the current 47.1% waive rate holds across all future filers:

| Filing rate among 53 no-filers | New filers | New waivers | New refunds | Total waivers (all time) | % of all 204 | Additional liability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 40% (~21 people) | 21 | 10 | 11 | **76** | 37.3% | ~$1,493 |
| 55% (~29 people) | 29 | 14 | 15 | **80** | 39.2% | ~$2,035 |
| 70% (~37 people) | 37 | 17 | 20 | **83** | 40.7% | ~$2,714 |
| 100% (all 53) | 53 | 25 | 28 | **91** | 44.6% | ~$3,799 |

**Headline at 100% filing**: if 47.1% holds all the way, **91 people** would have waived — forgiving a collective **~$10,250** in ticket value.

---

## Worst-Case Total Liability
If every one of the 53 non-filers filed a full refund (zero additional waivers):
- Additional exposure: ~$7,190 (est.)
- Combined with open filers: **~$11,989 (est.)** (matches current net still owed)

Realistic remaining obligation (pending filers + partial no-filers): **$6,000–$8,500**
*(Down sharply from Day 9 estimate of $7,000–$11,000 — non-filer pool nearly halved.)*

## The Full Community Picture
| What the community did | # of people | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Waived their refund | 66 | ~$7,435 (est.) |
| Donated (all donors) | 35 | $2,865.00 |
| Waived + donated | 9 | *(subset of above two)* |
| **Unique people who gave something back** | **92** | **~$10,300 (est.)** |

**45.1% of all 204 ticket holders** — by Day 14 — did something to actively support Charles and the festival rather than simply request their money back. Up from 37.1% on Day 9.

## Velocity Check-ins
- [x] **Day 9 (Feb 22)** — Snapshot taken. Zelle paused. Backlog: 6 open.
- [x] **Day 14 (Feb 27)** — Snapshot taken. Zelle still paused. Backlog: 27 open (held by Zelle, not review).
- [ ] **~Day 37 (Mar 22)** — Zelle resumes. First check after payments restart. Clear the backlog.
- [ ] **Day 30–35 (Mar 15–20)** — Refresh all numbers; waive rate should be stabilizing
- [ ] **Day 60 (Apr 14)** — Near-final snapshot; most who will file have filed
- [ ] **Final** — Refresh when process reaches ~85–90% completion
- [ ] Update `refund-system-recap.md` with final numbers for the community post
