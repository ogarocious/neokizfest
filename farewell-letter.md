# Neo Kizomba Festival — A Farewell

## The End

Neo Kizomba Festival is over. Not postponed. Over.

This wasn't the plan. After 8 editions over 10 years — with a COVID gap that tested all of us — I never imagined writing these words. But here we are.

This decision wasn't made lightly. It was made after years of trying, years of pushing, years of hoping next year would be different.

This chapter is closed.

## What We Built

Before I get into the harder parts of this letter, I want to honor what the Neo Kizomba Festival was.

We did things no one else was doing:

- Community & History Panels talks — real conversations about where this dance is going
- 4 Show Your Styles with Laurent — the first and only in the scene
- 2 Advanced training sessions with JP and Steffy
- The first-ever Urbankiz Jack & Jill (2019)
- The first Switch J&J
- Three levels of classes throughout the festival — fundamentals, intermediate, advanced — making Neokiz an entry point for everyone, not just the already-experienced
- Active taxi dancers to help with lead/follow ratio
- Women's care packages — tampons, chapstick, patches, ibuprofen — because details matter
- Airport pickup videos so you knew exactly where to go
- Feedback surveys after every edition — because I actually wanted to get better
- J&J divisions — Novice, Intermediate, Advanced — giving competitors a real pathway

From my experience, I treated artists better than I was ever treated at other festivals. Warm meals — not just pizza. Drinks and snacks throughout the day. Proper breakfasts. I made that a point because I knew what it felt like to be on the other side.

There were good memories. Real connections. People met partners, made friends, found something that changed them. That part was real, and I'm grateful for it.

## The Other Side: A Hired Artist's View

It's important to remember that I've also been on the other side of this equation; I am an artist who has been hired and traveled to many other festivals.

I understand firsthand how strenuous it is to work the social dance floor and try to maintain personal boundaries with attendees. Without clear boundaries, you can absolutely be depleted. For me, I always viewed my role on the social dance floor as an investment, and I would argue that if artists don't treat it as an investment in the scene's growth, the scene can't thrive. However, that perspective does not give attendees the entitlement to simply "ring a bell" and expect unlimited dances.

On the other side of this coin, later in the message, it's also important to note that artists typically have the highest reward to risk ratio.

My biggest frustrations as a traveling artist have often came from disorganization from those who claim to be "organizers". Waiting over an hour for an airport pickup or not getting proper food to sustain myself over a high-energy weekend is incredibly frustrating.

There is no official rulebook for these events; it's all very underground, and every festival is different. Typically, the food provided is not the healthiest, and often, if you miss the first 30 minutes of delivery — because you are teaching a private lesson or a class — very few events even set aside plates or food for artists in those situations so they have something to eat when they return. That experience is why I made artist care a priority at Neo Kizomba Festival to the best of my ability.

## What I Carried

Let me tell you what it actually took to make the festivals happen.

At any given edition, I was:

- Running the festival
- DJing
- Taxi dancing
- Taking professional photos
- Shooting and editing video
- Running the Jack & Jills
- Managing social media content
- Editing recap videos and promos
- Building and maintaining the website

I wasn't hoarding roles. I was filling gaps no one else would fill — at least not to the standard needed to keep the event alive.

This list above is more so during the event, and not including the work needed before and after as well.

## Why I Couldn't Build a Solid Team

"Why didn't you just get help?"

I didn't have the finances to build a team.

And without finances, what's the pitch? What's the job description?

"Hey, want to join me on this project? It's a ton of work. High stress. Very little appreciation. You probably won't get credit for what you do. The 'community' won't acknowledge your effort. And there's no payment."

Who's signing up for that? They can just buy their pass and enjoy the event on their terms instead of sacrificing their time working behind the scenes.

Building a team requires either money or a culture of genuine support. I didn't have the money, and the culture wasn't there.

So I did it myself. Not because I wanted to. Because there was no other option.

I built infrastructure in Where Can We Dance to organize artists' information — bios, promo pics, media kits, rooming preferences, dietary needs. Always trying to innovate. Always trying to systematize. Always trying to make it sustainable.

But beyond infrastructure, the scene's fixation on hype and trying to follow trends was fundamentally unsustainable. What was truly needed was a focus on pedagogy and established systems to provide a proper base for new dancers. The desire for hype, to be seen, and to be cool, ultimately clouded the foundational work required for the scene's sustainability. This created a culture of entertainers and consumers rather than students and teachers, making long-term growth nearly impossible.

There is no manual for organizing events. It was trial and error. Making mistakes. Learning. Making each edition better than the last. And still getting judged like I was supposed to have it all figured out from day one.

## My History as an "Artist" — Building From Nothing

Let me tell you about my "career" as an artist, though I feel I've been more of an educator.

Probably at least 50% of my bookings were self-hosted weekenders. I organized them myself. In cities across the United States, Canada, South America. I wasn't waiting for someone to roll out the red carpet for me. I understood what I was trying to contribute to was a growing dance, I was building at the grassroots level, trying to grow the scene.

A lot of artists just want to become good dancers and then get hired by festivals. They want the royalty treatment. They want the heat without generating any wood or fire. They just want to arrive and be celebrated.

But here's the reality: there aren't enough festivals to hire everyone. There are barely any festivals at all.

So I used my organizational skills and hustle to go out to other cities and host myself. "Roll the dice" on my own skill sets. Create flyers. Take photos. Find ticketing systems. Put my neck out to lose money.

And the scene is so new, even over the past ten years — we don't even have experienced organizers. So when artists complain that they want to get "hired by organizers"... I always ask myself "What organizers?!?!"

There are no experienced organizers. Most people running events in their local scenes are just trying to make something happen to help it grow so they have opportunities to dance in their scene. They're figuring it out as they go.

If someone has any organizing experience, they probably brought it from another industry. But most of us? We're learning in real time. This is a grassroots effort.

I brought my organizational skills to help other organizers in their cities — people who didn't have the marketing experience, didn't know how to make social media graphics, didn't do pre-workshop surveys or post-workshop surveys, didn't have ticketing systems dialed in. I helped them. On top of being the talent. On top of being the photographer. Because there wasn't enough money on the table to hire separate people for all of these roles.

I'm probably the artist who has done the most weekenders in this scene. Not because I got booked. Because I built them myself.

So for any artist who thinks their talent should be recognized — here's my advice: go out and buy your own flights, make your own flyers, find your own ticketing system. Put your neck out to potentially lose money, break even, or profit. Try to make something happen in your local scene or someone else's.

That's what I did. That's the work behind most of my career.

## The Economics No One Talks About

Let me break down some math.

I saw someone post about the "anxiety" of buying a $100–$200 festival pass, not knowing if the event would happen due to multiple events struggling to keep their events alive.

Let me tell you about anxiety.

**What an organizer carries:**

| Expense | Range |
|---------|-------|
| Artist flights | $8,000 – $15,000 |
| Artist payments/fees | $10,000 – $20,000 |
| Artist food & meals | $2,000 – $4,000 |
| Artist housing | $3,000 – $6,000 |
| Hotel contract / meeting space | $5,000 – $15,000 |
| Penalty if room nights not hit | $2,000 – $10,000 |
| Audio/sound equipment | $2,000 – $5,000 |
| Dance floor | $4,500 – $6,000 |
| Social media / marketing | $500 – $2,000 |
| Website / ticketing fees | $500 – $1,500 |
| Photography / videography | $1,000 – $3,000 |
| Insurance | $500 – $1,000 |
| Miscellaneous | $500 – $1,500 |
| **Total** | **$36,500 – $87,000** |

Plus managing volunteers. Managing taxi dancers. Trying to remember to eat. Trying to stay sane. Your reputation is on the line. Your personal credit on the line.

The organizer carries 250–400x the financial risk of the attendee posting about their "anxiety."

And that's just money. It doesn't include months of planning, years of reputation building, strained relationships, lost sleep, or the mental health toll.

## The Hierarchy of Risk

**Artists — lowest risk, highest reward:**
- Flight: covered
- Hotel: covered
- Food: covered
- Payment: guaranteed (in most cases)
- Private lessons: additional income organizers don't touch
- Some headliners charge up to €500/hour — more than most corporate jobs
- Worst case: they lose a booking
- They leave with net positive income

**Attendees — moderate risk:**
- Pass, flight, hotel
- Total exposure: $750 – $1,400
- Worst case: lose that money if the festival doesn't happen

**Organizers — highest risk, often no reward:**
- Total exposure: $36,500 – $87,000+
- Personal credit on the line
- Reputation on the line
- Months of unpaid labor
- Paid last — or not at all
- Worst case: bankruptcy, debt, mental health crisis
- Best case: you were extremely lucky to make a little profit and earned minimum wage if you were to accurately count all the hours worked

The organizer carries infinite times more risk than artists (who carry zero) and 30–40x more risk than attendees.

And yet — it seems there are more artists complaining that it's hard. Attendees post about their anxiety. Organizers are expected to smile and deliver flawlessly despite the workload or any losses.

## The Golden Goose

I've been thinking about the fable of the Golden Goose.

A goose lays golden eggs. The owner benefits. But instead of caring for the goose, the owner gets greedy — wants more, faster. Eventually kills the goose expecting to find all the gold inside. Finds nothing. And now there are no more golden eggs. Ever.

That's what this feels like.

The festival I built created a trickle-down effect for everyone:

- Hotels made money from 400+ room nights
- Airlines made money from travelers flying in
- Restaurants made money from where we chose to eat
- Floor vendors, sound vendors got paid
- Artists got flown in, housed, fed, paid — plus private lesson income
- Attendees got the experience, the memories, the connections

All of that was contingent on the work I was doing. I created the ecosystem. The platform. The thing that made everything else possible.

And yet — no one checked in on the goose.

The pressure was always: produce more. Do more. Make it bigger. Make it better. But no one asked: how do we sustain the person making all of this possible?

You can't keep pressuring the golden goose to produce more eggs while starving it, ignoring it, and demanding it perform. Eventually it dies. And then there are no more golden eggs for anybody.

That's what happened here.

It seems obvious to me that if you benefit from something, you should invest in sustaining it. But that didn't happen. And now the goose is cooked.

## The Aftermath Nobody Talks About

There have been many situations — not just mine — where the organizer loses everything and nobody cares.

Attendees had fun. Artists got paid. The organizer left running on fumes — or worse, in debt.

Where is the "community" at that moment?

The artists don't care if the organizer lost money. The scene doesn't seem to care either. No one checks in. No one asks "did you break even?"

The expectation is: do it again next year.

And if you can't? You're the problem.

## The Invisible Battle

As a small event compared to bigger corporate events, I was never a big piece of business to the hotels.

Hotel negotiation carries enormous weight when trying to do these events. So many times I had to fight against predatory contracts. Fighting not to be taken advantage of. So much caution required just to create a contract that was sustainable — just to have a glimmer of hope of not losing my ass. Going over every contract with a microscope to make sure my ignorance or misunderstanding of a particular term meant I would have to end up coughing up an unexpected $10,000 because I misread or misinterpreted some legal jargon.

No one sees that work. No one knows how many bad deals I walked away from. How many times I had to advocate for myself with no leverage. Just to get to a starting point where the event might be viable.

This isn't abstract history to just me — it's the heavy air I breathe every time I walk into a negotiation.

## The Weight I Carried

For centuries, the exploitation of Black talent, labor, and excellence has been a cornerstone of oppressive systems.

From the transatlantic slave trade, where African labor was forcibly extracted to build wealth for others, to the 13th Amendment's loophole that permits involuntary servitude as punishment for a crime — these patterns persist across generations.

Today, we see echoes in predatory contracts targeting Black athletes, entertainers, and creatives — contracts that strip away rights and ownership from the very people whose work creates immense value.

Black men have long faced the harshest scrutiny. We are glorified for our contributions to sports, music, and physical excellence — but simultaneously devalued in daily life when we are not providing access to our excellence in those ways.

As a Black dance instructor, educator, artist, organizer, and creative, I found myself navigating these same systems of exploitation, just in different forms.

The chains and whips of the past have evolved into different tools — tools designed to silence and sideline Black voices and bar Black ownership.

And on top of all that: being a Black American walking into rooms full of white hotel owners and sales staff. Negotiating contracts where the assumptions weren't in my favor. Having to be twice as sharp just to not get screwed.

When refunds were delayed, the assumption from the majority wasn't "he's struggling." It was anger, judgement, and suspicion. There was no benefit of the doubt.

How do I differentiate between those who truly value my work and those who see me as a token to serve their agenda? How can I distinguish between lip service — kind words meant to placate — and genuine action rooted in shared values?

These are questions I've had to ask constantly. And too often, the answers were disappointing.

## The Reality of No Safety Net

Let me be clear about something else:

Some organizers can afford to take a financial hit because they have extra money they can play and roll the dice with. They have a full-time job, trust fund, a partner with stable income, family money — something that cushions the blow when a festival loses money.

That was never my reality.

I was a dancepreneur. Dance was my income. Teaching, DJing, organizing — that was how I paid rent. That was how I kept my lights on and food on my table.

When the festival lost money, that wasn't "disappointing" or "unfortunate." That was me not eating properly for months. That was me delaying doctor's appointments. That was me lying awake calculating whether I could make rent.

I wasn't organizing Neo Kizomba as a passion project funded by some other career. I was trying to build something sustainable that could support my life.

And when it didn't work — when I carried all that risk and came out the other side in debt — I didn't have a safety net to fall back on.

That's the part people don't see. That's the part that doesn't get mentioned when someone posts "just do it again next year" or has so many opinions of what organizers should or shouldn't do.

## What "Community" Actually Meant

The word "community" gets used a lot in the dance scene.

But "community" isn't just showing up to dance and have a good time. "Community" isn't just holding space. "Community" isn't just offering an ear.

Community is holding weight.

Not just presence — partnership. Not just listening — lifting.

I've asked myself countless times: what good is holding space or talking about the struggle if the person you're holding it for is actively drowning?

Imagine someone actually drowning in a pool. And a well-meaning friend pulls up a chair and offers an ear to talk about their experience drowning.

You don't pull up a chair. You jump in to keep their head above water. You throw them a life ring. You pull them to safety.

Or imagine someone immobilized by a pile of heavy rocks on their back, trying to take even a tiny step forward — but they can't move under the weight. And again, a well-meaning friend pulls up a chair and offers an ear.

You don't sit and listen. You take some rocks off their back. You help lighten the load so they can move again.

That's what I needed. Not ears. Hands.

When I shared that I was struggling, the thing people most often offered was an ear. Someone to listen. I know that comes from a good place. It's what people have seen others offer. It's what they've received and found helpful. That's human. That's habit.

But being listened to wasn't what I needed.

I didn't need someone near me. I needed someone with me. Someone willing to carry even a small corner of the load — even just for a little while.

"I'm here if you need to talk" is the norm. I get that. But in this context, it wasn't useful.

I've seen what real "community", at least when it comes to other festivals in other dance styles, looks like elsewhere. Fundraisers where people step up to donate. Nonprofits coming together to help with funding. People showing up to set up and tear down. Multiple organizers wearing multiple hats, everyone pitching in.

This, in my opinion, feels like a better demonstration of "community" in action. That's sustained support and shared weight and effort.

That's not what I experienced.

Soooo many people showed up to just take, and give the least amount possible for the most upside. Not enough were willing to give or share the weight of the real work needed to pull off an enjoyable experience for everyone including the organizers.

I asked friends multiple times throughout the years from the community to help support the festival by resharing my promo on social media. It was like pulling teeth.

I reached out to some attendees who had a good experience at the festival for testimonials or a review, a fair amount just didn't reply or said they would but didn't or simply ghosted.

I asked artists to help promote. Very few did so consistently. The attitude was "that's your responsibility."

There wasn't an understanding of if we promote this together, there's enough sales to pull into the event, and you get paid. Your room gets paid, your food gets paid, and I don't have to fall on my face so I can continue keeping this event alive.

Every year I asked for feedback. Sent surveys. Tried to improve.

Not once did anyone check in on me or the team. Not once did anyone ask: "How are you doing? Did you make money? Did you break even?"

I don't think the organizer check-in is something that the dance scene does after any festival.

The system is designed to expect organizers to do more and more and more. But organizers are human.

And I kept asking myself: How much longer can I keep carrying this alone?

The answer, it turns out, was: not much longer.

## My Roots in Austin

People said I don't care about Austin.

Let me tell you about my Austin.

I went to elementary school here. Middle school here. My mom was born here. My grandmother — who has now passed — had three houses in East Austin.

Those houses are gone now. Lost to gentrification. Lost to the same forces that have been pushing Black Americans out of the neighborhoods they built, the neighborhoods they owned, the neighborhoods where they raised families for generations.

My family's story on my mom's side is the story of Black Austin. The displacement. Being priced out. Watching your legacy get erased while newcomers act like the history started when they arrived.

I have roots here. Generational roots. Legacy here.

So when someone spreads a rumor that I "don't care about Austin" — it's not just wrong. It's the kind of stupid, reckless shit people say to vilify someone without knowing a single thing about them.

I didn't move here to throw parties. I grew up here. My family built here. And I tried to build something here too.

## The Rumor That I Don't Pay Artists

Let me address this directly: I paid 100% of my artists.

Were there times I was late? Yes. Maybe 5% of the time. And the reason was simple — the festival didn't generate enough to cover everything immediately. I had to scramble. Muster up more ticket sales. Book private lessons. Find income from somewhere else just to make sure everyone got paid.

I wasn't pocketing money. I was trying to gather funds because what the festival made didn't carry over. I needed time.

And that information — the lateness, the struggle — got exploited. Twisted. Turned into a rumor that I "don't pay artists."

Which is crazy, because I'm still getting hit up by artists who want to work with Neokiz. If I didn't pay people, why would they keep reaching out?

This is the cutthroat, gossipy side of the scene. People know festivals are struggling. They know organizers are barely holding on. And instead of support, some see an opportunity — tear down other events to make theirs look better.

That's not "community". That's competition disguised as concern.

## Where I've Been

People have been wondering what I've been doing.

I have a full-time job now. I'm trying to get back on my feet in multiple senses.

I saw a comment: "The organizer (in this case, me) only cares about himself and his finances."

Yeah. I do.

With those same finances, I went to the dentist and got an overdue check-up and cleaning. I went to my cardiologist and scheduled an overdue appointment.

For those of you who may not be aware, I have had two open-heart surgeries, and I have a mechanical heart valve. The maintenance of that valve through my cardiologist check-ups and blood thinning medicine is vital to extend my quality of life while I'm here.

Those are things I had been putting off — for years — because all my money and risk was tied up in the festival.

I wasn't able to take care of myself properly. Basic healthcare. Basic human maintenance.

So yes, I care about my finances, because with those finances, I'm able to take care of myself as a human being.

That's not greed. That's survival.

Not a yacht, not a new car, no new jewelry, clothes or shoes.

Economic power determines our ability to resist. This isn't just about prosperity or success — it's about survival in its most fundamental form.

We cannot fight for the culture when we're fighting to keep our lights on. We cannot build community while dodging bill collectors. We cannot sustain this work when our bank accounts are empty.

I refuse to keep over-functioning for other people's entertainment while I can't afford to see a doctor, for so little appreciation and not enough money to make ends meet.

It's not sustainable. That's not "community". That's exploitation with a smile.

## The Silence

I was publicly called out by a few and of course the popcorn and comments follow.

Very few people checked in.

The cyberbullying and call-outs from other organizers — it really felt like an attempt to throw shade at other events to make their own "look better". Be mindful of that. Try to see the motive behind some of these messages.

When someone is tearing down another organizer publicly, ask yourself: what do they gain from this?

It's the age-old tactic of "I'm going to be the tallest building in town" by tearing everybody else's down vs. just focusing on myself and actually building a better building that will grow tall on its own.

And the artist egos — an unnecessary, annoying factor I had to navigate on top of everything else. Managing personalities while managing logistics while managing finances while managing my own sanity.

Artists I flew in, housed, and paid — silence.

One artist reached out. One.

It's fascinating — people wanted the accolade of being associated with Neokiz. They wanted it on their bio that they taught at my festival, competed in competitions I helped create. That association boosted their profiles.

And yet — silent when it came to actually supporting, contributing, or helping the event sustain itself.

It feels like artists are there for the "limo ride". As I mentioned before, the artists carry the least amount of risk and get the highest reward in most cases.

They'll smile in your face, do the minimum to get paid, and when it comes down to it — they're looking out for themselves.

That's disillusioning. That's a sadness I'm carrying.

I've used the word "community" for years. But the feeling of actual support still feels foreign to me.

I would ask this: anytime you see someone pointing a finger, ask yourself — before they pointed the finger, did they extend a helping hand?

## Taking a Selfish Stand

This journey has revealed something I needed to face.

Too often, we are invited to the table but not given a seat of power. We are contributors, but not decision-makers. We are the talent, but not the owners.

I poured my heart, sweat, and vision into amplifying Urbankiz and highlighting the cultural legacy of Kizomba — rooted in the African diaspora and connected to Black American culture through R&B and Hip-Hop. Urbankiz is a bridge.

This is not just an art form. It's a reflection of resilience, artistry, and history. It tells stories of struggle and triumph. And I worked to ensure those stories were heard — while also trying to afford my livelihood, pay my rent, and keep the lights on.

But I will not settle for being a low-level part of a system that extracts my labor and vision while others reap the rewards.

I refuse to just shut up and dance.

I am committed to ensuring that my work not only amplifies Black voices but also builds toward a future where we are not just parts of the system — but its leaders, visionaries, and rightful owners.

## What Happens Now

People paid for something they didn't get. I'm not disappearing.

Everyone will be offered a refund or the choice to waive it.

There will be public tracking so you can watch the progress. This level of transparency matters to me.

I could have ghosted. A lot have done so in the past. I'm not doing that.

## The Shirt

I'm offering a farewell t-shirt for those who want something tangible to mark this chapter.

It's not a cash grab. It's optional. It's for those who want closure — a way to honor what Neo Kizomba was, even as it ends. Every little bit helps me dig myself out of this hole.

Details will be on the site.

## What's Next

I don't know.

This chapter is closed. I need to clear this from my life — financially, mentally, emotionally — before I can think about what comes after.

I need to heal. There's grief in this. I'm grieving something I built for nearly a decade.

But I'm also proud.

I'm proud of the way I showed up. The level of excellence I maintained with limited funds and against all of these odds from multiple angles. The standard I set. I showed what Black excellence looks like in this scene — in the production quality, in the artist care, in the innovation, in the persistence. That's mine. No one can take that.

I am still very much loving coding and building. I'm making improvements to WCWD, Learntokiz, and a new project called VidHive. I've also been getting into event photography (a skill I brought to many events outside of my own to continue to try to help the presence of the dance grow online).

I've been playing more tennis.

## Thank You, Sarah

*[TO EXPAND — personalize further]*

I need to give a specific shout-out to Sarah.

She was my right hand. She took on so much work for this festival. Almost to a fault — she took on too much. She was crashing from all the logistics, trying to pull everything together with a very limited budget.

She didn't have to do any of it. She chose to. And she pushed herself to the edge for something she believed in.

Sarah — thank you. I see you. I see what you carried.

## Final Words

To those who genuinely showed up over the years — who volunteered, who promoted without being asked, who checked in, who understood what this took — thank you. You know who you are.

To everyone else: I hope this letter gives you a window into what it actually takes to build something for a scene. Maybe it'll change how you show up for the next organizer. Maybe it won't.

Either way, I said what I needed to say.
