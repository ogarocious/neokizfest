# Neo Kizomba Festival — Social Posts Log

Daily progress updates posted to Facebook. Screenshot of progress dashboard included with each post.

## Snapshot Format (standard fields)

```
- Overall Progress: X% (up from Y%)
- Resolved: X of 205 (+X)
- Total Requests: X (up from X)
- Completed: X
- Processing: X (X in review, X submitted)
- Waived: X (+X)
- Waived + Donated: X
- Donated: $X from X supporters
```

**Notes on format:**
- Never include chargeback counts — not in resolved, not in total requests, not anywhere
- Progress % = (completed + waived) / total_ticket_holders only
- Always provide caption as plain text (no markdown syntax) — paste-ready for Facebook

## Payment Status

Check this before drafting each post. Affects tone and any mention of payment timelines.

**Current status (as of Feb 22, 2026): PAUSED**
Zelle monthly transfer limit hit. Payments resume ~March 1, 2026 (when limit resets).
Wise (international) unaffected — those can still go out.

**When Zelle is PAUSED:**
- Do not reference payments going out or specific payment timelines
- Do not imply completed refunds are being actively paid
- If someone asks publicly, acknowledge it directly — no hiding it
- Focus post messaging on getting remaining people to file

**When Zelle is ACTIVE:**
- Can reference that payments are going out
- Can cite amounts paid when it's a notable milestone
- "Completed" count reflects paid + logged in Notion

## Voice Guidelines (I vs. We)

**Use "I" for Charles's individual labor:**
- Sending DMs, reviewing requests, processing payments, doing admin work
- Personal commitments and promises ("I'm not done until everyone is taken care of")
- "I've been reaching out directly" — own the work

**Use "we" for the community collectively:**
- The festival's story, the shared chapter being closed
- What the community has done together (waiving, donating, showing up)
- "We built something real here" — the collective journey

**Never use "we" as a vague authority.** If it's Charles doing it, say "I."

## Post #2 — Feb 18, 2026

**Platform:** Facebook
**Posted by:** Charles Neokiz Ogarocious

**Snapshot:**
- Overall Progress: 28% (up from 25%)
- Resolved: 58 of 204 (+8)
- Total Requests: 79 (up from 63 — now includes chargebacks)
- Processing: 21
- Waived: 24 (+2)
- Donated: $2,815 from 34 supporters (+$515)

**Caption:**

28% and counting.

Yesterday we were at 25%. Today, 58 of 204 pass holders are fully resolved — that's +8 in the last 24 hours.

Here's where things stand:

- 79 Total Requests (up from 63 — we've updated the dashboard to include chargebacks alongside form submissions, since those are refund obligations too)
- 58 Resolved — books are clean, no money owed
- 21 Processing — actively being reviewed and paid out
- 24 Waived — community members who chose to forgo their refund entirely
- $2,815 Donated from 34 supporters (up $515 since yesterday), including 8 people who waived AND donated back

Every single number is public. Every step is tracked. No back rooms, no "trust me bro" — just a live dashboard anyone can check at any time.

To my knowledge, no one in the kizomba scene — or really any dance scene — has ever done refunds this way. A real-time public progress tracker where every pass holder can see exactly where their request stands. We built this because transparency shouldn't be the exception. It should be the standard.

If you haven't submitted your refund request yet:
neokizfest.com — click "Request Refund" and follow the steps. Takes about 2 minutes.

Already submitted?
Check your status anytime at neokizfest.com — click "Status" and enter your email.

We're not done until everyone is made whole, and then we address other pending items on the list.

### Flowers Shoutout #2 — Feb 18, 2026 — Frances

**Platform:** Facebook
**Type:** Community appreciation / Flowers gallery + donation shoutout

**Notes:** Frances is a pioneer of the Seattle kizomba scene — one of the oldest in the country. She submitted a Flowers entry with a group photo from Charles's Seattle workshop visit, donated to the refund fund, and left a heartfelt message of support.

**Caption:**

🌸 Flowers for Frances.

This photo is from when NeoKiz came to Seattle — and it's one of my favorites.

Frances is one of the quiet architects of the Seattle kizomba scene — a community that holds the distinction of being one of the oldest kizomba scenes in the country. Long before kizomba had the visibility it has today, she was there, building something real, patient, and lasting in the Pacific Northwest.

She sent flowers to the gallery, she showed up with her heart open, and she gave generously to help us close this chapter with dignity.

Her words meant everything:

"I'm cheering you on for choosing yourself first... you'll get through it and reconnect with your passion once more."

Frances — you deserve every flower right back. Thank you for being a pioneer, a supporter, and a friend to this community. Seattle represents. 🌹

The Flowers gallery is open to everyone. If you have a memory, a photo, a voice note, a video, or just a few words — we want to hear it. Head to neokizfest.com → Flowers and leave your piece of this story. Every single one matters.

Daily update, February 19th. Here's where we stand.

Yesterday we were at 28%. This morning: 77 of 205 pass holders fully resolved — that's +19 in roughly 24 hours.

Here's what moved:

- 99 Total Requests (up from 79)
- 77 Resolved — done, closed, nothing owed
- 22 Processing — in the queue, actively being worked
- 38 Waived (+14 since yesterday) — 38 people chose to let it go and support the community
- $2,815 Donated from 34 supporters, including 8 who waived AND gave back

That waived number — 38 — is the one that keeps hitting me. These are people who had money on the table and decided to just… give it. No ask, no pressure. Just generosity.

We're not slowing down.

## Post #5 — Feb 21, 2026 (Day 8)

**Platform:** Facebook
**Posted by:** Charles Neokiz Ogarocious
**Payment status at time of post:** ACTIVE (payments still going out)

**Snapshot:**
- Overall Progress: ~50% (progress page crossed 50%)
- Total Requests: 107
- Completed: 42
- Active: 16
- Waived: 49
- Donated: $2,815 from 34 supporters

Day 8 update — NeoKizFest Refund Process

The progress page crossed 50% today.

Half of the festival community is fully resolved — refunds paid, passes waived, books clean. Eight days in.

Here's where things stand right now:

→ 107 people have submitted a refund request
→ 42 refunds have been paid in full
→ 49 people have waived their refund
→ 16 requests are actively in process — I'm working through them
→ 34 people have donated to help carry this — $2,815 total

The 49 waivers are the part that stays with me. That's 49 people who looked at their situation and said keep it — not because anyone asked them to, but because they chose to. I don't take that lightly.

If you know someone who was at NeoKizFest and hasn't seen what's happening, please pass this along. I'm sending direct messages every day, but word of mouth goes further than I can reach alone.

The process is at neokizfest.com — takes a few minutes, confirmation number right away. Any issues, message the festival Facebook page and I'll sort it out personally.

Halfway there. Thank you.

## Post #6 — Feb 22, 2026 (Day 9)

**Posted by:** Charles Neokiz Ogarocious
**Status:** Posted
**Payment status at time of post:** PAUSED (Zelle limit — payments resume ~March 1)

- Resolved: 95 of 205 (+16 since Post #4)

Day 9 update — NeoKizFest Refund Process

Payments are on hold temporarily — but the process isn't.

Here's where things stand right now:

→ 109 people have submitted a refund request (+2)
→ 44 refunds have been paid in full (+2)
→ 51 people have waived their refund (+2)
→ 6 requests are actively in process (down from 16)
→ 34 people have donated to help carry this — $2,815 total

On payments: I pushed through the remaining queue before hitting Zelle's monthly transfer limit. Those are done and logged. The 6 requests still in process are next — payments resume in March when the limit resets.

51 waivers. That number keeps growing. More than half of everyone who filed chose to let it go. I don't take that lightly.

If you haven't filed yet — neokizfest.com, takes a few minutes, confirmation number right away. Any issues, message the festival Facebook page and I'll sort it out personally.

Still going.

- Resolved: 79 of 205 (+2)
- Total Requests: 101 (up from 99)
- Completed: 33
- Processing: 22 (6 in review, 16 submitted)

Daily update, February 20th.

Yesterday we were at 38%. Today: 79 of 205 pass holders fully resolved — that's 39%.

Here's what moved:

101 Total Requests (up from 99)
79 Resolved — done, closed, nothing owed
22 In queue — 6 being actively reviewed, 16 submitted and waiting
46 Waived (+8 since yesterday) — 46 people chose to release their refund entirely
$2,815 donated from 34 supporters, including 9 who waived AND gave back

That waived number — 46. These are people who had real money on the line and decided to just let it go. No pressure, no ask. That's the community showing up for itself.

One thing I've noticed: email and social posts alone aren't cutting through. I've been sending direct messages every single day to reach people individually — and it's working, but slowly.

The easiest thing you can do — for both of us — is go straight to the website and handle it yourself. It takes 2 minutes.

Process your refund: neokizfest.com — click "Request Refund"
Check your status: neokizfest.com — click "Status"

If you run into any issues, message the festival Facebook page directly and I'll get it sorted.

I'm not done until everyone is taken care of.
