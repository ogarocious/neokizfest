- Overall Progress: 28% (up from 25%)
- Resolved: 58 of 204 (+8)
- Total Requests: 79 (up from 63 — now includes chargebacks)

28% and counting.

Yesterday we were at 25%. Today, 58 of 204 pass holders are fully resolved — that's +8 in the last 24 hours.

Here's where things stand:

- 79 Total Requests (up from 63 — we've updated the dashboard to include chargebacks alongside form submissions, since those are refund obligations too)
- 58 Resolved — books are clean, no money owed
- 21 Processing — actively being reviewed and paid out
- 24 Waived — community members who chose to forgo their refund entirely
- $2,815 Donated from 34 supporters (up $515 since yesterday), including 8 people who waived AND donated back

Every single number is public. Every step is tracked. No back rooms, no "trust me bro" — just a live dashboard anyone can check at any time.

To my knowledge, no one in the kizomba scene — or really any dance scene — has ever done refunds this way. A real-time public progress tracker where every pass holder can see exactly where their request stands. We built this because transparency shouldn't be the exception. It should be the standard.

If you haven't submitted your refund request yet:
neokizfest.com — click "Request Refund" and follow the steps. Takes about 2 minutes.

We're not done until everyone is made whole, and then we address other pending items on the list.

### Flowers Shoutout #2 — Feb 18, 2026 — Frances

**Platform:** Facebook
**Type:** Community appreciation / Flowers gallery + donation shoutout

**Notes:** Frances is a pioneer of the Seattle kizomba scene — one of the oldest in the country. She submitted a Flowers entry with a group photo from Charles's Seattle workshop visit, donated to the refund fund, and left a heartfelt message of support.

**Caption:**

🌸 Flowers for Frances.

This photo is from when NeoKiz came to Seattle — and it's one of my favorites.

Frances is one of the quiet architects of the Seattle kizomba scene — a community that holds the distinction of being one of the oldest kizomba scenes in the country. Long before kizomba had the visibility it has today, she was there, building something real, patient, and lasting in the Pacific Northwest.

She sent flowers to the gallery, she showed up with her heart open, and she gave generously to help us close this chapter with dignity.

Her words meant everything:

"I'm cheering you on for choosing yourself first... you'll get through it and reconnect with your passion once more."

Frances — you deserve every flower right back. Thank you for being a pioneer, a supporter, and a friend to this community. Seattle represents. 🌹

The Flowers gallery is open to everyone. If you have a memory, a photo, a voice note, a video, or just a few words — we want to hear it. Head to neokizfest.com → Flowers and leave your piece of this story. Every single one matters.

Daily update, February 19th. Here's where we stand.

Yesterday we were at 28%. This morning: 77 of 205 pass holders fully resolved — that's +19 in roughly 24 hours.

Here's what moved:

- 99 Total Requests (up from 79)
- 77 Resolved — done, closed, nothing owed
- 22 Processing — in the queue, actively being worked
- 38 Waived (+14 since yesterday) — 38 people chose to let it go and support the community
- $2,815 Donated from 34 supporters, including 8 who waived AND gave back

That waived number — 38 — is the one that keeps hitting me. These are people who had money on the table and decided to just… give it. No ask, no pressure. Just generosity.

We're not slowing down.
