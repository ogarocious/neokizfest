28% and counting.

Yesterday we were at 25%. Today, 58 of 204 pass holders are fully resolved — that's +8 in the last 24 hours.

Here's where things stand:

- 79 Total Requests (up from 63 — we've updated the dashboard to include chargebacks alongside form submissions, since those are refund obligations too)
- 58 Resolved — books are clean, no money owed
- 21 Processing — actively being reviewed and paid out
- 24 Waived — community members who chose to forgo their refund entirely
- $2,815 Donated from 34 supporters (up $515 since yesterday), including 8 people who waived AND donated back

Every single number is public. Every step is tracked. No back rooms, no "trust me bro" — just a live dashboard anyone can check at any time.

To my knowledge, no one in the kizomba scene — or really any dance scene — has ever done refunds this way. A real-time public progress tracker where every pass holder can see exactly where their request stands. We built this because transparency shouldn't be the exception. It should be the standard.

If you haven't submitted your refund request yet:
neokizfest.com — click "Request Refund" and follow the steps. Takes about 2 minutes.

Already submitted?
Check your status anytime at neokizfest.com — click "Status" and enter your email.

We're not done until everyone is made whole, and then we address other pending items on the list.
