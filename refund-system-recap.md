## The Story

When a festival gets cancelled and the internet turns hostile, the playbook is predictable: go dark, post a vague statement, wait for it to blow over. Charles Ogar built a website.

Not a landing page. Not a Google Form. A production-grade, full-stack web application — built solo, in a matter of weeks, while the festival was being publicly attacked — with a database-backed refund tracker, real-time progress dashboard, chargeback detection, automated emails, Square payment integration, artist payment receipts, a community gallery, and a donation flow. Seventeen distinct features, all wired together with privacy-first architecture so that 200+ people's personal information stayed protected even as everything else was being exposed.

That is not what someone with something to hide does. That is what radical accountability looks like.

**The community responded in kind.**

Nearly 1 in 4 pass holders — **44 people** — looked at the news and said *keep it*. They collectively handed back **$5,067.96** in refunds they were owed and never asked for back. Nine of those 44 then went further: they waived *and* came back to donate on top of it, adding another $905 to the total. Twenty-six more people who didn't even hold passes showed up to donate anyway.

When you count everyone who did something: **70 unique people**, **$7,882.96** in total community support. Winston Roche waived his pass, sent $200 via Venmo separately, and left a message that said simply: *"LOVE and RESPECT."* Dana Clouse waived both her tickets.

Tanisha Davis wrote: *"I believed in you then, and I still do."*

Sara Griess wrote: *"Neokiz 2023 was a literal life saver for me as I was deeply depressed and burnt out, teetering on the edge of giving up entirely. That moment of release saved me. It's impossible to put a price on those experiences, so waiving a pass and giving back to the cause is the least I can do."*

**Then there are the artists.**

Nine performers and DJs who worked NeoKizFest across its seven-year run — some for multiple editions — went on record publicly to confirm they were paid in full and treated with respect. DJ Sink, who worked five editions spanning 2018 to 2024, wrote: *"Throughout all these years, the Neokiz team has consistently taken great care of their artists. Flights, accommodations, transportation, artist management — everything has always been handled professionally and with attention to detail."*

Eri Kardos, a TEDx Speaker and teacher who worked the 2024 edition, wrote: *"My experience working with you was genuinely one of the best I've had at a large kizomba festival. I felt seen, supported, and well cared for."*

These aren't press releases. These are people who had no obligation to say anything, choosing to say something anyway — publicly, by name, with their faces attached.

**Thirty-three voices** contributed to the flowers gallery in total: 9 artists, 10 community members who submitted photos, videos, and memories, and 14 people who left written messages through the refund and donation flows. The festival was cancelled. People kept adding to it.

The site itself — visible at `neokizfest.com` — is the clearest possible answer to the accusations that were made. Every refund request is tracked, timestamped, and publicly accounted for. Every artist payment is documented. Every completed refund shows a "Paid" badge. The progress dashboard updates in real time. Any pass holder can look up their status by email. Any member of the public can see exactly what stage every request is in, without ever seeing anyone's personal information.

You cannot build that kind of transparency by accident. You build it on purpose, under pressure, when you know you have nothing to hide and everything to prove.

## To Revisit for Final Post
- Update all numbers when refunds reach ~100% completion
- Add final waived count, donated total, and overall % of ticket holders who gave something back
- Consider adding: total # of editions, total years NeoKiz ran (2018–2024)
- Consider pulling a few more community message quotes if more get approved
- Note whether any new artist testimonials are added to the gallery
- "[TO EXPAND]" — any personal closing note from Charles to weave in?
