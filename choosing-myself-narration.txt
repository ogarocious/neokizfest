The End

The Neo Kizomba Festival is ending. Not postponed. Over.

This wasn't the plan. After 8 editions over 10 years, with a COVID gap that tested all of us, I never imagined writing these words under these circumstances, but here we are.

And I'm writing them because I'm choosing myself.

For the first time in over a decade, I'm choosing my health, my peace, and my future over a scene that, on balance, took more than it gave back. This letter is my farewell to the festival. This is my truth, and my experience of things I endured over the past decade.

This chapter of the festival is closed.


What We Built

Before I get into the harder parts, I want to honor what the Neo Kizomba Festival was. Because it was something.

We did things very few others were doing:

Community andHistory Panels, real conversations about where this dance came from and where it's going

4 Show Your Styles with Laurent and the SYS crew

2 Advanced training sessions with JP and Steffy

Three levels of classes throughout the festival, fundamentals through advanced, making Neokiz an entry point for everyone, not just the already-experienced

Hour-and-a-half classes with 30-minute breaks in between, because we cared about the learning experience and giving attendees time to rest, decompress, and connect between sessions

The first-ever Urbankiz Jack andJill (2019)

The first Switch J and J

J and J divisions, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, giving competitors a real pathway

Active taxi dancers to help with lead/follow ratio

Women's care packages, tampons, chapstick, patches, and ibuprofen, because details matter

Airport pickup videos so you knew exactly where to go

Feedback surveys after every edition, because I genuinely wanted to get better

People met partners at this festival. Made lifelong friends. Found a dance that changed them. Some people walked in not knowing what Urbankiz was and walked out with a new passion. That part was real, and I carry those memories with gratitude.

Some of my favorite memories:

Working alongside Laurent was something special. He was a brother from another mother. We were shoulder to shoulder, trying to influence the scene in a positive direction. His intellectual approach to dance content, the way he used words to inspire and not tear people down, that resonated with me deeply. I miss that partnership. And that epic dance he had with Steffy at the first-ever Jack andJill? I still watch that video and smile.

I genuinely loved the Jack andJills. Watching dancers progress over the years, seeing someone compete at one level and come back stronger the next time, sometimes across multiple events. That growth was one of the most rewarding things to witness.

The fundamentals track was a personal joy. I knew a lot of people didn't have access to Urbankiz classes or weekly socials in their cities, so I tried to weave real learning opportunities into the festival. Giving newcomers a space where they could learn without being intimidated was something I cared about deeply.

That closing DJ set Sunday night in 2024. Ninja handed me a drink, I was buzzed and in the zone, and the songs just came to me. Completely off the cuff. No plan. Just flow. I listen to that mix a lot still. That one stays with me.

The pool parties were a blast. And I'll never forget scheming to get Sarah into one of the rooms so the crowd could give her the applause she deserved for everything she was doing behind the scenes. That moment definitely mattered.

I made it a point to treat artists better than I'd been treated at other festivals. Warm meals, not just pizza. Drinks and snacks throughout the day. Proper breakfasts. I made that a priority because I knew what it felt like to be on the other side and not feel seen or cared for.


A Decade of Swimming Upstream

I need to give you the full picture, because this didn't happen overnight.

Phase 1: The Early Years.

When I first started investing in growing Urbankiz in the U.S., the resistance came from the traditionalists. I was bullied at events. Called out in posts. Dismissed for pushing a dance that didn't fit the mold. I kept building anyway.

Phase 2: The Growth Years.

As Urbankiz started gaining some traction and legitimacy, the resistance shifted. North American artists boycotting the festival and my brand. No communication. No conversation. Just cut off. Lots of what felt like entitlement and hype publicly with very little substance. I kept building anyway.

Phase 3: Now.

Public accusations. Gossip. The same pattern, just a different source.

Every single phase, I was doing the work of building something for the scene offline and online. And every single phase, the resistance came from the people who also benefited from what I was building.

At some point, you have to ask yourself: how long can you swim upstream before you drown?

I hit my limit.


What I Carried

Let me tell you what it actually took to keep this festival alive.

At any given edition, I was:

Running the festival (laying flooring, setting up sound, hotel negotiations, wristbands, coordinating flight and workshop schedules, and budgeting; Sarah was instrumental the last 4 editions)

DJing

Taxi dancing

Taking professional photos

Shooting and editing video

Running the Jack andJills

Managing social media content

Editing recap videos and promos

Building and maintaining the website

And that's just during the event. It doesn't include the months of stress and planning before or the work after.

I wasn't hoarding roles. Outside of Sarah, a few coordinators, and the volunteers who stepped up over the years, I was filling gaps that very few people would step up to fill.

And it wasn't just me.

I have a vivid memory of Sarah carrying a speaker to load in a car between venues. The speaker was taller than half her body. She was moving it by herself. And at least four DJs were sitting right there, watching her, not lifting a finger to help.

That image says more about the entitlement culture around these events than any paragraph I could write.

Equipment needs to be moved. Floors need to be laid down. People need to be checked in. Cleanup needs to happen afterward. These are basic operational needs that come with putting on an event. And yet, organizers and the people closest to them are often left doing most to all of it while others sit back and turn a blind eye.

If each person just picked up after themselves, it would lighten the load during clean up and tear down. But that simple level of consideration rarely happens in my experience.

"Why didn't you just get help?"

I didn't have the finances to build a team. And without finances, what's the pitch?

"Hey, want to join me on this project? It's a ton of work. High stress. I'll appreciate you, but the scene won't. You probably won't get any recognition for it. And little to no payment."

Who's signing up for that? They can just buy a pass and enjoy the event on their own terms instead of sacrificing their time behind the scenes.

And if you're the main organizer, you're footing the bill for whatever's left over. Everyone else gets to enjoy the event. You get the invoice.

Building a team requires either money or a culture of genuine support. I didn't have the money, and the culture wasn't there. Not enough people were willing to roll up their sleeves and share the weight.

The earlier editions had coordinators who stepped up and carried real weight. The later editions had Sarah, who was involved in a large majority of the operation. There were volunteers too -- but you can only ask so much of people who also came to enjoy the event. They deserve to take classes, compete in the Jack andJills, and actually dance. And there's still a level of compensation involved -- comped passes, hotel rooms, travel. Balancing that cost against how much work to ask of them, without overworking them, was always a tricky exchange. So the core of the planning, the financial risk, the year-round work between editions -- that still fell on me. Not because I wanted to carry it all. Because there's a limit to what you can put on someone else's shoulders, and even that limited help still comes at a cost.


What an Artist Sees, What an Organizer Carries

I've been on both sides of this equation. I'm an artist who's been hired and traveled to festivals and weekenders. I understand firsthand how strenuous it is to work the social floor and maintain boundaries with attendees. I've always viewed my role on the social floor as an investment in the scene's growth.

My biggest frustrations as a traveling artist came from disorganization. Waiting over an hour for airport pickup. Not getting proper food to sustain myself over a high energy demanding weekend. Missing meals because you were teaching a private or a class, and no one set aside a plate.

There is no rulebook for these events. It's all underground, and every festival is different. Those experiences are why I made artist care a priority at the Neo Kizomba Festival.

But here's what I also learned from being on both sides:

Artists carry the least risk and receive the highest reward.

Flight: covered

Hotel: covered

Food: covered

Payment: guaranteed in most cases

Private lessons: additional income organizers don't touch

Some international headliners charge up to 500 euros per hour for privates

Worst case: they lose a booking

They leave with net positive income

To put that in perspective: the average hourly wage in the United States is roughly $35 to $37. Even earning $50/hour puts you well above the national average. Some of these artists are charging 500 euros per hour, which is roughly $540. That's more than most corporate executives make per hour.

Anyone can charge what they want. That's their right. But when those fees are being absorbed by organizers who are already operating at a loss, funded by personal credit, and working hundreds of unpaid hours, the math doesn't work. It's not sustainable unless you have deep pockets, a philanthropic mindset, or the ability to absorb financial losses. Most organizers trying to build something sustainable and keep it alive don't have those luxuries.

And if you were to count every hour an organizer puts into planning, promoting, negotiating, building, executing, and cleaning up, many of them are effectively working for free. Or worse, paying out of pocket for the "privilege" of doing it.

I don't know where this narrative came from that organizers are rolling in money. That has not been my experience, and from conversations with the majority of other organizers, it's not theirs either.

Attendees carry moderate risk.

Pass, flight, and hotel

Total exposure: $750 to $1,400

Organizers carry the highest risk, often with no reward.

Total exposure: $36,500 to $87,000+

Personal credit on the line

Reputation on the line

Months of unpaid labor

Paid last, or not at all

Best case: minimum wage if you count all the hours

Let me break that organizer number down for an international level festival at a hotel venue:

Artist flights: $8,000 - $15,000
Artist payments/fees: $10,000 - $20,000
Artist food and meals: $2,000 - $4,000
Artist housing: $3,000 - $6,000
Hotel contract / meeting space: $5,000 - $15,000
Penalty if room nights not hit: $2,000 - $10,000
Audio/sound equipment: $2,000 - $5,000
Dance floor: $4,500 - $6,000
Social media / marketing: $500 - $2,000
Website / ticketing fees: $500 - $1,500
Photography / videography: $1,000 - $3,000
Insurance: $500 - $1,000
Miscellaneous: $500 - $1,500
Total: $36,500 - $87,000

The organizer carries 250 to 400 times the financial risk of the attendee. And that's just the money. It doesn't include the mental health toll, the strained relationships, or the lost sleep.

And yet, the organizer is the one expected to smile and deliver flawlessly. While artists complain it's hard. While some attendees post about their anxiety over a $100 to $200 pass.

My intention is not to minimize anyone's experience. But I need the full picture to be visible. Because it feels like it rarely has been.

And since we're making the full picture visible, let me share another part of it.

There's a narrative that organizers can be bullies. And I'm sure some can. But from my experience, that dynamic runs both ways.

I've dealt with international artists who used intimidation, blackmail, and false claims to try to damage my reputation when things didn't go exactly their way. Artists who benefited from being flown in, housed, fed, and paid, and then turned around and threatened to trash the event privately/publicly if their demands weren't met.

That's not professionalism at all. It's bullying. And it's a dynamic that organizers often have to navigate while still trying to deliver a great experience for attendees and uphold their commitments to artists and attendees.

And organizers are expected to just absorb it. Smile through it. Keep it moving. Because if you speak up, you're the "difficult" one. You're the bully. Meanwhile, you're the one who put your credit on the line, spent months planning, and created the very opportunity they're trying to exploit.

I don't think most attendees or community members have any idea how much unnecessary conflict organizers navigate behind the scenes, on top of the financial stress, the logistics, and the pressure to deliver a flawless experience.

There is either a profound naivete or a deep sense of entitlement when it comes to what it actually takes to pull off a well-run event. I'm not sure which one it is. But the gap between what people expect and what it costs to deliver is staggering.


The Golden Goose

I've been thinking about the fable of the Golden Goose.

A goose lays golden eggs. The owner benefits. But instead of caring for the goose, the owner gets greedy, wants more, faster. Eventually kills the goose expecting to find all the gold inside. Finds nothing. And now there are no more golden eggs. Ever.

That's what this feels like in some ways.

The festival created a trickle-down effect for everyone:

Hotels made money from 400+ room nights

Airlines made money from travelers flying in

Restaurants made money from group dinners

Floor vendors and sound vendors got paid

Artists got flown in, housed, fed, and paid, plus private lesson income

Attendees got the experience, the memories, and the connections

All of that was built on the work the team and I were doing. We created the ecosystem. The platform. The thing that made everything else possible.

The Jack andJill divisions gave competitors a real pathway -- novice, intermediate, advanced. Placing in those divisions gave dancers credibility they could carry with them. Results that ended up in bios, on social media, at other events. That came from this platform.

DJs and teachers looked to the Neo Kizomba Festival as a stamp of approval. I can't tell you how many people messaged me about wanting to teach or DJ at the festival. Being on the lineup carried weight. It was something people wanted on their resume.

When things were good, everybody wanted to ride in the limo. Now, in this time of need -- the equivalent of standing at the bus stop in the rain -- ask me where those artists are.

Everyone wanted to pick the fruit. But nobody was watering the roots. The festival was bearing fruit for the whole scene -- credibility, platforms, opportunities, income. But very few people thought about what it takes to keep the tree alive. You can't keep picking and never pour water back in. Eventually the tree stops growing. Eventually there's nothing left to pick.

Beyond the festival, I also built Where Can We Dance, a resource for the broader community to find events and connect. I hosted the Olympiads of Kizomba competitions, which gave dancers national and international titles. Both lost money. And the Olympiads still came with the expectation of flying winners to Europe to compete.

All of these accomplishments ended up on people's bios, dance resumes, and social media profiles. If you looked at the credentials many dancers and artists carry today, you'd find that a significant number of them came directly from the platforms and opportunities I helped build over the past decade.

And not enough people asked: how do we sustain the person making all of this happen?

The pressure was always: produce more, do more, make it bigger, make it better. But the support to match that pressure rarely came.

You can't keep expecting golden eggs while starving the goose. Eventually it dies. And then there are no more eggs for anybody.


What "Community" Actually Means

The word "community" gets used a lot in the dance scene. I want to share what it means to me, based on my experience building something for this community for over a decade.

"Community" isn't just showing up to dance and have a good time. It isn't just holding space. It isn't just offering an ear.

Community is holding weight.

Not just presence, but collaboration. Not just listening, but lifting.

Imagine someone drowning in a pool. A well-meaning friend pulls up a chair and offers to listen to their experience drowning.

You don't pull up a chair. You jump in. You throw them a life ring. You PULL them to safety.

That's what I needed. Not ears. Hands.

When I shared that I was struggling, the thing people most often offered was someone to listen. I know that comes from a good place. That's human. That's habit.

But being listened to wasn't what I needed.

I didn't need someone near me. I needed someone with me. Someone willing to carry even a small corner of the load, even for a little while.

I asked friends from the community to reshare promos on social media. It was like pulling teeth.

I reached out to attendees who had great experiences for testimonials. A fair number didn't reply, said they would but didn't, or simply ghosted.

I asked artists to help promote. Very few did so consistently. The attitude was "that's your responsibility."

There wasn't an understanding that if we promote together, there are enough sales to keep the event alive, artists get paid, and I don't have to fall on my face.

Every year I asked for feedback and sent surveys in order to continually improve.

What about people checking in on me or the team? Very few people asked: "How are you all doing? Did you make money? Did you break even?"

Some did. And to those people: I see you, and I'm grateful. But it unfortunately wasn't enough for the size of what we were carrying.

I've seen what real community (at least from the outside) looks like at festivals in other dance styles. Fundraisers where people step up to donate. Nonprofits coming together to help with funding. People showing up to set up and tear down. Multiple organizers wearing multiple hats, everyone pitching in. Multiple members of the community financially sponsoring different parts of the event.

That's sustained support. That's shared weight.

That's not what I experienced at the scale I needed.

Here's what I hope the scene starts to understand: most events are not a business move. Unless the organizer has deep pockets and is throwing money at it for the sake of it, a festival is a labor of love. It exists for the benefit of the community.

But if the community doesn't step up to support the thing that was built for them, eventually there won't be anything left to enjoy. The organizer isn't the one benefiting the most. The people dancing, making memories, and having the time of their lives -- they're the ones benefiting the most. The artists, like I said before, carry the least risk and walk away with the highest reward.

If those people don't see the event as something worth investing in -- worth keeping alive -- then the roots dry up, the engine stops, and there's nothing left for anybody.


Building from Nothing

Let me tell you about my career as an artist, though I feel I've been more of an educator.

Probably at least 50% of my bookings were self-hosted weekenders. I organized them myself, in cities across the United States, Canada, and South America. I wasn't waiting for someone to roll out the red carpet. I understood what I was trying to contribute to was a growing dance. I was building at the grassroots level.

There aren't enough festivals to hire everyone. There are barely any festivals at all. And there are very few experienced true organizers. Most people running events are figuring it out as they go, bringing whatever skills they have from other industries or learning in real time.

I brought my organizational skills to help other organizers in their cities. People who didn't have marketing experience, didn't know how to make social media graphics, didn't do pre-workshop or post-workshop surveys, didn't have ticketing systems dialed in. I helped them. On top of being the talent. On top of being the photographer. Because there wasn't enough money to hire separate people for all of these roles.

Beyond the infrastructure, the scene's fixation on hype is/was fundamentally unsustainable. What is/was truly needed was a focus on pedagogy and established systems to provide a proper base for new dancers and growth to stronger dancers and teachers. The desire to be seen and to be cool ultimately clouded the foundational work required for sustainability.

This created a culture of entertainers and consumers rather than students and teachers. And that made long-term growth nearly impossible.

Having invested as much time as I have into this scene over the past decade, through the intellectual dance content, the festivals, the weekenders, the pedagogy, leading the Facebook group, it is deeply disappointing to see that investment yield so little fruitful growth. Not disappointing in a passing sense. Disappointing in the way that grief is disappointing. You keep pouring into something hoping it'll grow, and eventually you run out of water.


Grace in the Underground

Here's something I need the scene to sit with.

This is an underground dance world, meaning it's not mainstream. There are no standards. No universities. No certificates. No degrees. Not when it comes to social dancing.

There is no class for how to throw a social. No training on how to negotiate with a hotel. No certification for becoming an instructor. No degree program for performing, organizing, or running a festival.

Most of us are learning as we go. That's the reality.

And yet, there's very little grace extended to the people doing the learning in real time, in public, with real money and real consequences.

Community is not perfect. Organizers are not perfect. Artists are not perfect. If that's the starting point, then the response to imperfection shouldn't be finger-pointing, name-calling, and public scrutiny. It should be curiosity. It should be dialogue.

"How can we work through this?" "What would make this right for both sides?" "What can we do differently going forward?"

Those are the questions I wish I heard more often. Instead, what I've seen too often is people who are quick to take offense, quick to point fingers, and slow to ask questions or seek solutions.

The dance world is a microcosm of the real world. It's diverse. Full of different perspectives, backgrounds, and opinions. The history underneath what we do is deep, complex, and still being uncovered.

And within that complexity, what I see too often are people who act like they have all the answers. People who are loud and quick to throw shade, but lack curiosity and empathy. People who make audacious claims to garner attention, but aren't prepared to listen, empathize, or work toward a solution.

What I wish I saw more of: humble, curious, solution-oriented people who are willing to sit down, have a real conversation, and figure out how to move forward together in a way that everyone can feel good about.

That's what I tried to contribute to building. That's what I hoped for. And too often, that's not what showed up.


No Safety Net

Some organizers can afford to take a financial hit because they have a full-time job, a secondary business, family money, something that cushions the blow.

That was never my reality.

I was a dancepreneur and a freelancer. Dance and freelancing were my income. Teaching, DJing, organizing, and picking up freelance work; that was how I paid rent. That was how I kept my lights on and food on my table.

When the festival lost money, that wasn't just "disappointing." That was me not eating properly for months. Delaying doctor's appointments. Lying awake calculating whether I could make rent.

And navigating all of this as a Black man in America added layers that most people in this scene may never fully understand.

Walking into whole rooms of white hotel executives and sales staff who definitely did not have my best interests in mind. Having to be twice as sharp just to not get taken advantage of. Fighting against predatory contracts with no leverage and no legal team. Going over every clause with a microscope because one misunderstood term could mean an unexpected $10,000 bill.

Very few people see that work. Very few know how many bad deals I walked away from. How many times I had to advocate for myself alone, just to get to a starting point where the event might be viable.

When refunds were delayed, the majority assumption wasn't "he's struggling." It was anger, judgment, and suspicion. There was no benefit of the doubt, and as a Black man in America, that's a pattern I know all too well.

For centuries, the exploitation of Black talent, labor, and excellence has been a cornerstone of oppressive systems. From the transatlantic slave trade, where African labor was forcibly extracted to build wealth for others, to predatory contracts that still target Black athletes, entertainers, and creatives today, these patterns persist.

Black men have long faced the harshest scrutiny. We are glorified for our contributions to sports, music, and physical excellence, but simultaneously devalued when we are not providing access to that excellence.

As a Black dance instructor, educator, artist, organizer, and creative, I found myself navigating these same systems of exploitation, just in different forms.

I wasn't organizing the Neo Kizomba Festival as a passion project funded by some other career. I was trying to build something sustainable that could support my life. When it didn't work, I didn't have a safety net to fall back on.

That's the part people don't see.

As we navigate more and more levels of awareness, privilege, intersectionality, and uncovering dark histories of systemic racism and their continued impacts today, none of that is disconnected from the festival that we were trying to create.


My Roots in Austin

Local members here in Austin have gossiped and said I don't care about Austin.

Let me tell you about my history in Austin.

I went to elementary school here. Middle school here. My mom was born here. My grandmother, who has now passed, had three houses in East Austin.

Those houses are gone now. Lost to gentrification. Lost to the same forces that have been pushing Black Americans out of the neighborhoods they built, owned, and raised families in for generations.

My family's story on my mom's side is the story of Black Austin. The displacement. Being priced out. Watching your legacy get erased while newcomers act like the history started when they arrived.

I have roots here. Generational roots.

So when someone spreads a rumor that I "don't care about Austin," it's not just wrong. It's reckless. It's the kind of claim people make to vilify someone without knowing a single thing about them.

I didn't move here to throw parties. I grew up here. My family built here. And I tried to build something here too.


The Accusations

Let me address this directly: I paid 100% of my artists.

Were there times I was late? Yes. A small percentage. And the reason was simple; the festival didn't generate enough to cover everything immediately. I had to scramble. Book private lessons. Find income from somewhere else just to make sure everyone got paid.

I wasn't pocketing money. I was trying to gather funds because what the festival made didn't carry over. I needed time.

If I were pocketing money, I would have used it to take care of my health. I would have seen my cardiologist more often. I would have seen a dentist. I would have taken care of my body, which was my mechanism for my primary source of income.

And that information got exploited. Twisted into a rumor that I "don't pay artists."

Take a look at the artist page and the repeat artists who came back over the years. If they weren't getting paid, they wouldn't have come back for multiple editions.

I have receipts. I have proof. I have context for every situation. And I'll share that on the artist page so you can see for yourself.

Three particular issues come to mind when it comes to these accusations of not paying artists:

1. A situation where an artist didn't provide their payment information for a year and a half.

2. A situation where an artist had legal issues that prevented them from obtaining an ESTA to enter the US. Flights were already purchased. We spent hours on the phone with airlines and absorbed roughly $1,500 in additional expenses scrambling to get them here -- and they completely ignored the extra cost it took us to get them to the event.

3. A situation where an artist was upset about losing a booking due to the festival's cancellation and still expected to be paid for work that never happened -- while I was struggling to keep a roof over my head. Meanwhile, the majority of other artists were far more empathetic to the situation.

That last one is worth sitting with. When an organizer is drowning financially and has to cancel for mental health or financial reasons, and your response is to still have your hand out -- zoom out. Who is the person hurting the most in that situation? This goes back to what I said earlier: artists carry the least risk and receive the highest reward. And even in a moment of genuine struggle, some still prioritized their lost income over the person who was falling apart trying to make it all work.

I will post about these in more detail later in a separate post. But the point is, there were documented issues that caused delays in payment. There was a history of attempts to resolve those issues. And there was context for why those issues existed in the first place.

But I want to say something broader about accusations in this scene.

In this age of AI-generated media and rapidly spreading narratives, it is a dangerous thing to operate on "guilty until proven innocent," especially when the accused is a Black man. Our demographic has historically faced the harshest sentences and penalties in this country.

When someone makes a public claim with no proof, no documented attempts at resolution, no history shown, that's not accountability. That's gossip weaponized.

And when a community runs with those claims without asking a single question, without any discernment or maturity, you're not holding someone accountable. You're participating in a pile-on.

I would ask this: any time you see someone pointing a finger, ask yourself: before they pointed the finger, did they extend a helping hand? Did they show proof? Did they attempt to resolve it privately?

If the answer is no, be very careful about what you amplify.

Some of the loudest call-outs came from competing organizers. Ask yourself what they had to gain by tearing down another event. The oldest tactic: become the tallest building in town by demolishing everyone else's, instead of simply building something better.


Why I'm Choosing Myself

I saw a comment: "The organizer only cares about himself and his finances."

Yes. I finally do. If I don't take my own well-being into consideration, who else is going to?

With those finances, I went to the dentist and got an overdue checkup and cleaning. I went to my cardiologist and scheduled an overdue echocardiogram to ensure my heart is functioning properly with my mechanical aortic heart valve to live as long of a life that God will allow me.

For those who may not be aware, I've had two open-heart surgeries. I have a mechanical aortic heart valve. The maintenance of that valve through cardiologist visits and blood-thinning medicine is vital to extending my quality of life.

My father passed in 2022, which compounded the financial strain on my family. The cost of living has gone up. The pandemic hit right after my second surgery in 2020.

Those are things I had been putting off for years because all my money and risk was tied up in the festival. I wasn't able to take care of myself properly. Basic healthcare. Basic human maintenance.

So yes, I care about my finances. Because with those finances, I'm able to take care of myself as a human being. I feel we are all entitled to that level of basic health care.

That's not greed. That's survival.

Not a yacht, not a new car, and no new jewelry, clothes, or shoes. Doctor visits, clothes, food, and rent.

Economic power determines our ability to resist. This isn't about prosperity; it's about survival in its most fundamental form.

We cannot fight for the culture when we're fighting to keep our lights on. We cannot build community while dodging bill collectors. We cannot sustain this work when our bank accounts are empty.

I put the festival and the scene first for too long, and I'm paying the price for it. For my own sanity, for my own health, for my own life, I have to make a change.

I refuse to keep over-functioning for other people's entertainment while I can't afford to see a doctor. That's not "community." That's unsustainable.

So I'm choosing myself.


What Happens Now

I know it's been months. I owe you an explanation for the silence.

After the cancellation, I was dealing with anxiety and panic attacks. Every time I posted anything, it was met with questioning I didn't have answers for, which made it harder to show up publicly.

I tried reaching out to people I thought could help me see this through. Multiple times. Multiple people. And every single one fell through.

I don't know if it was the complexity of everything, or the weight of it, but when people saw what was actually involved, they stepped back. Some said they'd help and didn't follow through. Some went quiet. The result was the same -- I was back where I started, alone with all of it.

A lot of people offered to listen. I appreciated that. But listening didn't handle the refunds. Listening didn't move anything forward. What I needed was someone willing to help me either run the event one more time or close it responsibly. That help never came. Not at the level I needed, despite how many times I asked.

That's part of how I got to this point.

I was also dealing with a grant situation that didn't operate with the transparency or integrity it should have. It put me in a legal chokehold that I am still fighting my way out of. I'll leave it at that for now, but it added a significant layer of stress to an already overwhelming situation.

I needed time to resettle. Emotionally, mentally, and financially. To get to a place where I could address this clearly, not reactively.

The silence wasn't me running. It was me choosing myself to get through the darker days.

If I had the mental capacity to respond sooner, I would have.

I'm sorry it took this long. Responding before I was ready, with the support I did not have, would have put me in a mental place I'm not sure I would have been able to come back from.

People paid for something they didn't get. I'm not disappearing.

Everyone will be offered a refund, the choice to waive it, and/or the option to make a donation.

There will be public tracking so you can watch the progress. This level of transparency matters to me.

I could have ghosted. Others in this scene have. I'm not doing that.

Even now, the same skills and drive that built this festival are showing up in how I'm closing it. A custom-built refund and donation system with public accountability. An artist payment tracker I built in part because, as a Black man in this scene, my word alone was never going to be enough. These aren't the actions of someone cutting corners. This is what excellence under pressure looks like, even on the way out.

For my own sanity and well-being, I won't be sharing a payment schedule or promising a completion date. Refund timing will depend on my monthly income, my well-being, and Zelle's daily transfer limits. The progress tracker will show every step transparently.


What's Next

I don't know.

The festival chapter is closed. I need to clear this from my life, financially, mentally, and emotionally.

I need to heal. There's grief in this. I'm grieving something I invested in for over a decade.

But I'm also proud.

I'm proud of what we built and the level of excellence the team and I maintained with limited funds and against all of these odds. The standard we set and the innovative ideas we brought to the scene. The way we built a platform for artists to share their work and get paid. The way we created a space for people to learn and grow. A place that was more than just an event, but a place where people could connect, share, and feel seen.

That's ours. No one can take that.

I've been getting into event photography, a skill I brought to many events outside of my own to help grow the dance's online presence. I'm making improvements to WCWD, Learntokiz, and a new project called VidHive. I'm still very much loving coding and building.

I've been playing more tennis, investing in my health, and spending more time with my two cats.


Thank You, Sarah

Sarah was my right hand for the last four editions: 2019, 2022, 2023, and 2024.

She wasn't just helping. She was embedded in the operation.

She was in the hotel email threads, the artist chats, and the Notion workspace where we coordinated everything. She carried logistics that most people will never know about. Coordinating artist schedules, managing volunteers, tracking what needed to happen and when, pulling things together under enormous pressure. She did this while holding down her own life, her own responsibilities, her own stress.

She worked too hard. To a fault. She gave more of herself than was sustainable, and I watched it take a toll. That's something I carry; knowing that the weight of what I was building landed on her in ways that weren't fair.

She didn't have to do any of it. She chose to. And she pushed herself to the edge for something she believed in.

I owe her. Not just gratitude, but financially. That is also on my list of matters to address. She sacrificed too much to walk away empty-handed.

Whatever Sarah needs to do for her own peace moving forward, she has every right to do it. She's earned that and then some.

I want to be clear about something: the Neo Kizomba Festival was my project, my name, and my responsibility. The refunds are mine to handle. If you have questions or concerns about the refund process, bring them to me. Please do not tag, message, or direct refund inquiries to Sarah. She gave more than enough. Let her be.

Sarah, thank you. I see you. I see what you carried. You deserve every flower and every bit of peace that comes your way. I hope you know how much I appreciate you, and if you ever need anything, I'm only one call away.


Final Words

To those who genuinely showed up over the years, who volunteered, who promoted without being asked, who checked in, who understood what this took: thank you. You know who you are, and I hope you know it mattered.

To the scene: I hope this letter gives you a window into what it actually takes to build something. If events keep closing their doors and organizers keep burning out, it's not because they failed. It's because the model is broken, and I realize there are some organizers that are really the furthest thing from organized, and also there are just not enough people willing to roll up their sleeves to help build and sustain.

If the community doesn't change how it supports the people who build these spaces, there simply won't be spaces to dance in. We're already seeing that unfold. If you want to dance, you have to care about the people who build the spaces you dance in. You have to care about their well-being, their mental health, and their financial stability. You have to care about them as human beings, not just as entertainers or service providers.

I gave what I had. For over a decade, I gave what I had.

And now I'm choosing what's left of me.


Neo Kizomba Festival. 8 Editions. 10 Years. One legacy.

When life gives you lemons, make lemonade.

The same organizational skills, professionalism, coding ability, and thoughtfulness that I poured into building this festival over 10 years, I'm now pouring into closing this chapter with as much integrity as I humanly can.

From the inspired dancer who became an artist and organizer, and gave what he could for over a decade, who hoped his investments in the scene would yield growth that never came, to the person who is now choosing himself,

Charles Ogar, "Mr. Neokiz"
