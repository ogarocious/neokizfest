# Neo Kizomba Festival vs. Choosing Myself

## The End

Neo Kizomba Festival is over. Not postponed. Over.

This wasn't the plan. After 8 editions over 10 years, with a COVID gap that tested all of us, I never imagined writing these words.

But here I am. And I'm writing them because I'm choosing myself.

For the first time in a decade, I'm choosing my health, my peace, and my future over a scene that took more than it gave back. This letter is my farewell, my truth, and my line in the sand.

This chapter is closed.

## TL;DR

- Neo Kizomba Festival is over. Not postponed. Over.
- The 6-month silence wasn't me running. I was dealing with anxiety, panic attacks, and needed time to resettle mentally and financially before I could address this properly.
- Everyone will be offered a refund, with public tracking so you can watch the progress. I could have ghosted. I'm not doing that.
- I paid 100% of my artists. Some payments were late because the festival didn't generate enough to cover everything immediately, not because I was pocketing money.
- I have two open-heart surgeries and a mechanical heart valve. I was putting off basic healthcare because all my money was tied up in the festival. I'm choosing my health.
- The model is broken. Organizers carry 250 to 400 times the financial risk of attendees, often with no reward. If the scene doesn't change how it supports the people who build these spaces, there won't be spaces to dance in.
- To those who genuinely showed up, volunteered, promoted without being asked, and checked in: thank you. You know who you are.

## What We Built

Before I get into the harder parts, I want to honor what Neo Kizomba Festival was. Because it was something.

We did things very few others were doing:

- Community & History Panels, real conversations about where this dance came from and where it's going
- 4 Show Your Styles with Laurent, the first and only in the scene
- 2 Advanced training sessions with JP and Steffy
- The first-ever Urbankiz Jack & Jill (2019)
- The first Switch J&J
- Three levels of classes throughout the festival, fundamentals through advanced, making Neokiz an entry point for everyone, not just the already-experienced
- Active taxi dancers to help with lead/follow ratio
- Women's care packages, tampons, chapstick, patches, ibuprofen, because details matter
- Airport pickup videos so you knew exactly where to go
- Feedback surveys after every edition, because I genuinely wanted to get better
- J&J divisions, Novice, Intermediate, Advanced, giving competitors a real pathway

People met partners at this festival. Made lifelong friends. Found a dance that changed them. Some people walked in not knowing what Urbankiz was and walked out with a new passion. That part was real, and I carry those memories with gratitude.

Some of my favorite memories:

Working alongside Laurent was something special. He was a brother from another mother. We were shoulder to shoulder, trying to influence the scene in a positive direction. His intellectual approach to dance content, the way he used words to inspire and not tear people down, that resonated with me deeply. I miss that partnership. And that epic dance he had with Steffy at the first-ever Jack & Jill? I still watch that video and smile.

I genuinely loved the Jack & Jills. Watching dancers progress over the years, seeing someone compete at one level and come back stronger the next time, sometimes across multiple events. That growth was one of the most rewarding things to witness.

The fundamentals track was a personal joy. I knew a lot of people didn't have access to Urbankiz classes or weekly socials in their cities, so I tried to weave real learning opportunities into the festival. Giving newcomers a space where they could learn without being intimidated was something I cared about deeply.

That closing DJ set in 2024. Ninja handed me a drink, I was buzzed and in the zone, and the songs just came to me. Completely off the cuff. No plan. Just flow. I listen to that mix and I dance. That one stays with me.

The pool parties were a blast. And I'll never forget scheming to get Sarah into one of the rooms so the crowd could give her the applause she deserved for everything she was doing behind the scenes. That moment mattered.

From my experience, I treated artists better than I was ever treated at other festivals. Warm meals, not just pizza. Drinks and snacks throughout the day. Proper breakfasts. I made that a priority because I knew what it felt like to be on the other side.

## A Decade of Swimming Upstream

I need to give you the full picture, because this didn't happen overnight.

**Phase 1: The Early Years.**
When I first started investing in growing Urbankiz in the U.S., the resistance came from the traditionalists. I was bullied at events. Called out in posts. Dismissed for pushing a dance that didn't fit the mold. I kept building anyway.

**Phase 2: The Growth Years.**
As Urbankiz started gaining some traction and legitimacy, the resistance shifted. North American artists boycotted the festival and my brand. No communication. No conversation. Just cut off. Lots of hype publicly with very little substance. I kept building anyway.

**Phase 3: Now.**
Public accusations. Gossip. Silence from people I invested in for years. The same pattern, just a different source.

Every single phase, I was doing the work of building something for the scene. And every single phase, the resistance came from the people who benefited from what I was building.

At some point, you have to ask yourself: how many times can you swim upstream before you drown?

I hit my limit.

## What I Carried

Let me tell you what it actually took to keep this festival alive.

At any given edition, I was:

- Running the festival (laying flooring, setting up sound, hotel negotiations, wristbands, coordinating flight and workshop schedules, budgeting; Sarah was a huge help the last 4 editions)
- DJing
- Taxi dancing
- Taking professional photos
- Shooting and editing video
- Running the Jack & Jills
- Managing social media content
- Editing recap videos and promos
- Building and maintaining the website

And that's just during the event. It doesn't include the months of planning before or the work after.

I wasn't hoarding roles. I was filling gaps that nobody else would fill, at least not to the standard needed to keep the event alive.

And it wasn't just me.

I have a vivid memory of Sarah carrying a speaker between venues. The speaker was taller than half her body. She was moving it by herself. And at least four or five DJs were sitting right there, watching her, not lifting a finger to help.

That image says more about the culture around these events than any paragraph I could write.

Equipment needs to be moved. Floors need to be laid down. People need to be checked in. Cleanup needs to happen afterward. These are basic operational needs that come with putting on an event. And yet, organizers and the people closest to them are often left doing all of it while others sit back and wait for the red carpet to roll out.

If each person just picked up after themselves, it would lighten the load significantly. But that level of consideration rarely showed up without being asked for.

"Why didn't you just get help?"

I didn't have the finances to build a team. And without finances, what's the pitch?

"Hey, want to join me on this project? It's a ton of work. High stress. Very little appreciation. You probably won't get credit for what you do. And there's no payment."

Who's signing up for that? They can just buy a pass and enjoy the event on their own terms instead of sacrificing their time behind the scenes.

Building a team requires either money or a culture of genuine support. I didn't have the money, and the culture wasn't there. Not enough people were willing to share the weight.

So I did it myself. Not because I wanted to. Because there was no other option.

## What an Artist Sees, What an Organizer Carries

I've been on both sides of this equation. I'm an artist who's been hired and traveled to festivals. I understand firsthand how strenuous it is to work the social floor and maintain boundaries with attendees. I've always viewed my role on the social floor as an investment in the scene's growth.

My biggest frustrations as a traveling artist came from disorganization. Waiting over an hour for airport pickup. Not getting proper food to sustain myself over a high energy demanding weekend. Missing meals because you were teaching a private or a class, and no one set aside a plate.

There is no rulebook for these events. It's all underground, and every festival is different. That experience is why I made artist care a priority at Neo Kizomba Festival.

But here's what I also learned from being on both sides:

**Artists carry the least risk and receive the highest reward.**

- Flight: covered
- Hotel: covered
- Food: covered
- Payment: guaranteed in most cases
- Private lessons: additional income organizers don't touch
- Some international headliners charge up to €500/hour for privates
- Worst case: they lose a booking
- They leave with net positive income

To put that in perspective: the average hourly wage in the United States is roughly $35 to $37. Even earning $50/hour puts you well above the national average. Some of these artists are charging €500/hour, which is roughly $540. That's more than most corporate executives make per hour.

Anyone can charge what they want. That's their right. But when those fees are being absorbed by organizers who are already operating at a loss, funded by personal credit, and working hundreds of unpaid hours, the math doesn't work. It's not sustainable unless you have deep pockets, a philanthropic mindset, or the ability to absorb financial hits indefinitely. Most organizers trying to build something sustainable and keep it alive don't have that luxury.

And if you were to count every hour an organizer puts into planning, promoting, negotiating, building, executing, and cleaning up, many of them are effectively working for free. Or worse, paying out of pocket for the privilege of doing it.

I don't know where this narrative came from that organizers are rolling in money. That has not been my experience, and from conversations with other organizers, it's not theirs either.

**Attendees carry moderate risk.**

- Pass, flight, hotel
- Total exposure: $750 to $1,400

**Organizers carry the highest risk, often with no reward.**

- Total exposure: $36,500 to $87,000+
- Personal credit on the line
- Reputation on the line
- Months of unpaid labor
- Paid last, or not at all
- Best case: minimum wage if you count all the hours

Let me break that organizer number down:

| Expense                        | Range                 |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Artist flights                 | $8,000 – $15,000      |
| Artist payments/fees           | $10,000 – $20,000     |
| Artist food & meals            | $2,000 – $4,000       |
| Artist housing                 | $3,000 – $6,000       |
| Hotel contract / meeting space | $5,000 – $15,000      |
| Penalty if room nights not hit | $2,000 – $10,000      |
| Audio/sound equipment          | $2,000 – $5,000       |
| Dance floor                    | $4,500 – $6,000       |
| Social media / marketing       | $500 – $2,000         |
| Website / ticketing fees       | $500 – $1,500         |
| Photography / videography      | $1,000 – $3,000       |
| Insurance                      | $500 – $1,000         |
| Miscellaneous                  | $500 – $1,500         |
| **Total**                      | **$36,500 – $87,000** |

The organizer carries 250 to 400 times the financial risk of the attendee. And that's just money. It doesn't include the mental health toll, the strained relationships, or the lost sleep.

And yet, the organizer is the one expected to smile and deliver flawlessly. While artists complain it's hard. While attendees post about their "anxiety" over a $100 to $200 pass.

I'm not minimizing anyone's experience. But I need the full picture to be visible. Because it rarely has been.

And since we're making the full picture visible, let me share another part of it.

There's a narrative that organizers can be bullies. And I'm sure some can. But from my experience, that dynamic runs both ways.

I've dealt with international artists who used intimidation, blackmail, and false claims to try to damage my reputation when things didn't go exactly their way. Artists who benefited from being flown in, housed, fed, and paid, and then turned around and threatened to trash the event publicly if their demands weren't met.

That's not professionalism. That's leverage disguised as grievance.

And organizers are expected to just absorb it. Smile through it. Keep it moving. Because if you speak up, you're the "difficult" one. You're the bully. Meanwhile, you're the one who put your credit on the line, spent months planning, and created the very opportunity they're trying to exploit.

I don't think most attendees or community members have any idea how much unnecessary conflict organizers navigate behind the scenes, on top of the financial stress, the logistics, and the pressure to deliver a flawless experience.

## The Golden Goose

I've been thinking about the fable of the Golden Goose.

A goose lays golden eggs. The owner benefits. But instead of caring for the goose, the owner gets greedy, wants more, faster. Eventually kills the goose expecting to find all the gold inside. Finds nothing. And now there are no more golden eggs. Ever.

That's what this feels like in some ways.

The festival created a trickle-down effect for everyone:

- Hotels made money from 400+ room nights
- Airlines made money from travelers flying in
- Restaurants made money from group dinners
- Floor vendors, sound vendors got paid
- Artists got flown in, housed, fed, paid, plus private lesson income
- Attendees got the experience, the memories, the connections

All of that was built on the work the team and I were doing. We created the ecosystem. The platform. The thing that made everything else possible.

And not enough people asked: how do we sustain the person/team making all of this happen?

The pressure was always: produce more, do more, make it bigger, make it better. But the support to match that pressure rarely came.

You can't keep expecting golden eggs while starving the goose. Eventually it dies. And then there are no more eggs for anybody.

## What "Community" Actually Means

The word "community" gets used a lot in the dance scene. I want to talk about what it meant in practice.

"Community" isn't just showing up to dance and have a good time. It isn't just holding space. It isn't just offering an ear.

Community is holding weight.

Not just presence, but collaboration. Not just listening, but lifting.

Imagine someone drowning in a pool. A well-meaning friend pulls up a chair and offers to listen to their experience drowning.

You don't pull up a chair. You jump in. You throw them a life ring. You PULL them to safety.

That's what I needed. Not ears. Hands.

When I shared that I was struggling, the thing people most often offered was someone to listen. I know that comes from a good place. That's human. That's habit.

But being listened to wasn't what I needed.

I didn't need someone near me. I needed someone with me. Someone willing to carry even a small corner of the load, even for a little while.

I asked friends from the community to reshare promos on social media. It was like pulling teeth.

I reached out to attendees who had great experiences for testimonials. A fair number didn't reply, said they would but didn't, or simply ghosted.

I asked artists to help promote. Very few did so consistently. The attitude was "that's your responsibility."

There wasn't an understanding that if we promote together, there are enough sales to keep the event alive, artists get paid, and I don't have to fall on my face.

Every year I asked for feedback. Sent surveys. Tried to improve.

Not once did enough people check in on me or the team. Very few people asked: "How are you all doing? Did you make money? Did you break even?"

Some did. And to those people: I see you, and I'm grateful. But it wasn't enough for the size of what we were carrying.

I've seen what real community (at least from the outside) looks like at festivals in other dance styles. Fundraisers where people step up to donate. Nonprofits coming together to help with funding. People showing up to set up and tear down. Multiple organizers wearing multiple hats, everyone pitching in. Multiple members of the community fiscally sponsoring different parts of the event.

That's sustained support. That's shared weight.

That's not what I experienced at the scale I needed.

## Building from Nothing

Let me tell you about my career as an artist, though I feel I've been more of an educator.

Probably at least 50% of my bookings were self-hosted weekenders. I organized them myself, in cities across the United States, Canada, South America. I wasn't waiting for someone to roll out the red carpet. I understood what I was trying to contribute to was a growing dance. I was building at the grassroots level.

There aren't enough festivals to hire everyone. There are barely any festivals at all. And there are very few experienced organizers. Most people running events are figuring it out as they go, bringing whatever skills they have from other industries or learning in real time.

I brought my organizational skills to help other organizers in their cities. People who didn't have marketing experience, didn't know how to make social media graphics, didn't do pre-workshop or post-workshop surveys, didn't have ticketing systems dialed in. I helped them. On top of being the talent. On top of being the photographer. Because there wasn't enough money to hire separate people for all of these roles.

Beyond the infrastructure, the scene's fixation on hype was fundamentally unsustainable. What was truly needed was a focus on pedagogy and established systems to provide a proper base for new dancers. The desire to be seen and to be cool ultimately clouded the foundational work required for sustainability.

This created a culture of entertainers and consumers rather than students and teachers. And that made long-term growth nearly impossible.

As one of the people who has invested the most time into this scene over the past decade, through the podcast, the festivals, the weekenders, the pedagogy, leading the Facebook group, it is deeply disappointing to see that investment yield so little fruitful growth. Not disappointing in a passing sense. Disappointing in the way that grief is disappointing. You pour into a vision for over ten years and watch the soil not take.

## Grace in the Underground

Here's something I need the scene to sit with.

This is an underground dance world. There are no standards. No universities. No certificates. No degrees. Not when it comes to social dancing.

There is no curriculum for how to throw a social. No training on how to negotiate with a hotel. No certification for becoming an instructor. No degree program for performing, organizing, or running a festival.

Every single one of us is learning as we go. That's the reality.

And yet, there's very little grace extended to the people doing the learning in real time, in public, with real money and real consequences.

Community is not perfect. Organizers are not perfect. Artists are not perfect. If that's the starting point, then the response to imperfection shouldn't be finger-pointing, name-calling, and public scrutiny. It should be curiosity. It should be dialogue.

"What happened?" "How can we work through this?" "What would make this right for both of us?"

Those are the questions I wish I heard more often. Instead, what I've seen too often is people who are quick to take offense, quick to point fingers, and slow to ask questions or seek solutions.

The dance world is a microcosm of the real world. It's diverse. Full of different perspectives, backgrounds, and opinions. The history underneath what we do is deep, complex, and still being uncovered.

And within that complexity, what I see too often are people who act like they have all the answers. People who are loud, but not curious. People who make audacious claims to garner attention, but aren't prepared to listen, empathize, or work toward a solution.

What I wish I saw more of: humble, curious, solution-oriented people who are willing to sit down, have a real conversation, and figure out how to move forward together in a way that everyone can feel good about.

That's what I tried to build. That's what I hoped for. And too often, that's not what showed up.

## No Safety Net

Let me be clear about something.

Some organizers can afford to take a financial hit because they have a full-time job, a partner with stable income, family money, something that cushions the blow.

That was never my reality.

I was a dancepreneur. Dance was my income. Teaching, DJing, organizing; that was how I paid rent. That was how I kept my lights on and food on my table.

When the festival lost money, that wasn't "disappointing." That was me not eating properly for months. Delaying doctor's appointments. Lying awake calculating whether I could make rent.

And navigating all of this as a Black man in America added layers that most people in this scene may never fully understand.

Walking into rooms of white hotel owners and sales staff to negotiate contracts where the assumptions weren't in my favor. Having to be twice as sharp just to not get taken advantage of. Fighting against predatory contracts with no leverage and no legal team. Going over every clause with a microscope because one misunderstood term could mean an unexpected $10,000 bill.

Very few people see that work. Very few know how many bad deals I walked away from. How many times I had to advocate for myself alone, just to get to a starting point where the event might be viable.

When refunds were delayed, the assumption wasn't "he's struggling." It was anger, judgment, and suspicion. There was no benefit of the doubt.

For centuries, the exploitation of Black talent, labor, and excellence has been a cornerstone of oppressive systems. From the transatlantic slave trade, where African labor was forcibly extracted to build wealth for others, to predatory contracts that still target Black athletes, entertainers, and creatives today, these patterns persist.

Black men have long faced the harshest scrutiny. We are glorified for our contributions to sports, music, and physical excellence, but simultaneously devalued when we are not providing access to that excellence.

As a Black dance instructor, educator, artist, organizer, and creative, I found myself navigating these same systems of exploitation, just in different forms.

I wasn't organizing Neo Kizomba as a passion project funded by some other career. I was trying to build something sustainable that could support my life. When it didn't work, I didn't have a safety net to fall back on.

That's the part people don't see.

As we navigate more and more levels of awareness, privilege, intersectionality, and uncovering dark histories of systemic racism and their continued impacts today, none of that is disconnected from the festival that we were trying to create.

## My Roots in Austin

Local members here in Austin have gossiped and said I don't care about Austin.

Let me tell you about my history in Austin.

I went to elementary school here. Middle school here. My mom was born here. My grandmother, who has now passed, had three houses in East Austin.

Those houses are gone now. Lost to gentrification. Lost to the same forces that have been pushing Black Americans out of the neighborhoods they built, owned, and raised families in for generations.

My family's story on my mom's side is the story of Black Austin. The displacement. Being priced out. Watching your legacy get erased while newcomers act like the history started when they arrived.

I have roots here. Generational roots.

So when someone spreads a rumor that I "don't care about Austin," it's not just wrong. It's reckless. It's the kind of claim people make to vilify someone without knowing a single thing about them.

I didn't move here to throw parties. I grew up here. My family built here. And I tried to build something here too.

## The Accusations

Let me address this directly: I paid 100% of my artists.

Were there times I was late? Yes. A small percentage. And the reason was simple; the festival didn't generate enough to cover everything immediately. I had to scramble. Book private lessons. Find income from somewhere else just to make sure everyone got paid.

I wasn't pocketing money. I was trying to gather funds because what the festival made didn't carry over. I needed time.

If I were pocketing money, I would have used it to take care of my health. I would have seen my cardiologist. I would have seen a dentist. I would have taken care of my body, which was my mechanism for my primary source of income.

And that information got exploited. Twisted into a rumor that I "don't pay artists."

Which is interesting, because I'm still getting contacted by artists who want to work with Neokiz. If I didn't pay people, why would they keep reaching out?

I have receipts. I have proof. I have context for every situation. And I'll share that on the artist page so you can see for yourself.

Two particular issues come to mind when it comes to these accusations of not paying artists:

1. A situation where an artist didn't provide their payment information for a year and a half.
2. A situation where an artist's criminal record created issues with US entry, which affected flights we had already purchased and forced us to absorb additional expenses to fulfill the lineup we had promised.

I will post about these in more detail later.

But I want to say something broader about accusations in this scene.

In this age of AI-generated media and rapidly spreading narratives, it is a dangerous thing to operate on "guilty until proven innocent," especially when the accused is a Black man. Our demographic has historically faced the harshest sentences and penalties in this country.

When someone makes a public claim with no proof, no documented attempts at resolution, no history shown, that's not accountability. That's gossip weaponized.

And when a community runs with those claims without asking a single question, without any discernment or maturity, you're not holding someone accountable. You're participating in a pile-on.

I would ask this: any time you see someone pointing a finger, ask yourself; before they pointed the finger, did they extend a helping hand? Did they show proof? Did they attempt to resolve it privately?

If the answer is no, be very careful about what you amplify.

Some of the loudest call-outs came from competing organizers. Ask yourself what they had to gain by tearing down another event. The oldest tactic: become the tallest building in town by demolishing everyone else's, instead of simply building something better.

## Why I'm Choosing Myself

I saw a comment: "The organizer only cares about himself and his finances."

Yes. I do.

With those finances, I went to the dentist and got an overdue checkup. I went to my cardiologist and scheduled an overdue appointment to ensure my heart is functioning properly with my mechanical aortic heart valve to live as long of a life that God will allow me.

For those who may not be aware, I've had two open-heart surgeries. I have a mechanical aortic heart valve. The maintenance of that valve through cardiologist visits and blood-thinning medicine is vital to extending my quality of life.

My father passed in 2022, which compounded the financial strain on my family. The cost of living has gone up. The pandemic hit right after my second surgery in 2020.

Those are things I had been putting off for years because all my money and risk was tied up in the festival. I wasn't able to take care of myself properly. Basic healthcare. Basic human maintenance.

So yes, I care about my finances. Because with those finances, I'm able to take care of myself as a human being.

That's not greed. That's survival.

Not a yacht, not a new car, no new jewelry, clothes, or shoes. Doctor visits, clothes, food, and rent.

Economic power determines our ability to resist. This isn't about prosperity; it's about survival in its most fundamental form.

We cannot fight for the culture when we're fighting to keep our lights on. We cannot build community while dodging bill collectors. We cannot sustain this work when our bank accounts are empty.

I put the festival and the scene first for too long, and I'm paying the price for it. For my own sanity, for my own health, for my own life, I have to make a change.

I refuse to keep over-functioning for other people's entertainment while I can't afford to see a doctor. That's not "community." That's exploitation with a smile.

So I'm choosing myself.

## What Happens Now

I know it's been months. I owe you an explanation for the silence.

After the cancellation, I was dealing with anxiety and panic attacks. Every time I posted anything, it was met with questioning that made it harder to show up publicly. I tried reaching out to people I thought could help me see this through, and that didn't happen, which is part of how I got to this point.

I was also dealing with a grant situation that didn't operate with the transparency or integrity it should have. I'll leave it at that for now, but it added a significant layer of stress to an already overwhelming situation.

I needed time to resettle. Mentally and financially. To get to a place where I could address this clearly, not reactively.

The silence wasn't me running. It was me choosing myself to get through the darker days.

If I had the mental capacity to respond sooner, I would have.

I'm sorry it took this long. Responding before I was ready would have put me in a mental place I wasn't sure I could come back from.

People paid for something they didn't get. I'm not disappearing.

Everyone will be offered a refund, the choice to waive it, and/or making a donation.

There will be public tracking so you can watch the progress. This level of transparency matters to me.

I could have ghosted. Others in this scene have. I'm not doing that.

For my own sanity and well-being, I won't be sharing a payment schedule or promising a completion date. Refund timing will depend on my monthly income and Zelle's daily transfer limits. The progress tracker will show every step transparently.

## What's Next

I don't know.

This chapter is closed. I need to clear this from my life, financially, mentally, emotionally, before I can think about what comes after.

I need to heal. There's grief in this. I'm grieving something I built for nearly a decade.

But I'm also proud.

I'm proud of the way I showed up. The level of excellence I maintained with limited funds and against all of these odds. The standard I set. I showed what's possible when someone gives everything they have, and I showed what happens when a scene doesn't give enough back.

That's mine. No one can take that.

I've been getting into event photography, a skill I brought to many events outside of my own to help grow the dance's online presence. I'm making improvements to WCWD, Learntokiz, and a new project called VidHive. I'm still very much loving coding and building.

I've been playing more tennis.

## Thank You, Sarah

Sarah was my right hand for the last four editions: 2019, 2022, 2023, and 2024.

She wasn't just helping. She was embedded in the operation.

She was in the hotel email threads, the artist chats, and the Notion workspace where we coordinated everything. She carried logistics that most people will never know about. Coordinating artist schedules, managing volunteers, tracking what needed to happen and when, pulling things together under enormous pressure. She did this while holding down her own life, her own responsibilities, her own stress.

She worked too hard. To a fault. She gave more of herself than was sustainable, and I watched it take a toll. That's something I carry; knowing that the weight of what I was building landed on her in ways that weren't fair.

She didn't have to do any of it. She chose to. And she pushed herself to the edge for something she believed in.

I owe her. Not just gratitude, but financially. Any donations or extra contributions that come through this process will go toward making that right. She sacrificed too much to walk away empty-handed.

Whatever Sarah needs to do for her own peace moving forward, she has every right to do it. She's earned that and then some.

**I want to be clear about something: Neo Kizomba Festival was my project, my name, and my responsibility. The refunds are mine to handle. If you have questions or concerns about the refund process, bring them to me. Please do not tag, message, or direct refund inquiries to Sarah. She gave more than enough. Let her be.**

Sarah, thank you. I see you. I see what you carried. You deserve every flower.

## Final Words

To those who genuinely showed up over the years, who volunteered, who promoted without being asked, who checked in, who understood what this took: thank you. You know who you are, and I hope you know it mattered.

To the scene: I hope this letter gives you a window into what it actually takes to build something. If events keep closing their doors and organizers keep burning out, it's not because they failed. It's because the model is broken, and not enough people are willing to fix it.

If the community doesn't change how it supports the people who build these spaces, there simply won't be spaces to dance in. We're already seeing that.

I gave what I had. For over a decade, I gave what I had.

And now I'm choosing what's left of me.

**Neo Kizomba Festival.** 8 Editions. 10 Years. Done.

_When life gives you lemons, make lemonade._

_The same organizational skills, professionalism, coding ability, and thoughtfulness that I poured into building this festival over 10 years, I'm now pouring into closing this chapter with as much integrity as I humanly can._

_From the inspired dancer who became an artist and organizer, and gave what he could for over a decade,_
